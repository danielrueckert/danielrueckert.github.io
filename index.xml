      <description>&lt;p&gt;Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning is a very recent topic of ongoing research. Especially in the medical field large amounts of data are locked due to privacy regulations. PPML allows the training on data of patients while asserting they face no repercussions by participating. Lots of applications need to be researched in depth. Exact project definitions would be specified depending on your interests and talents, but range from rather theoretical work to heavily applied projects. If you are interested kindly send us a message including your CV, transcript of records, and very briefly what you are looking for, expecting in your thesis, your talents and interests are and if applicable a short description of a project that you did.

      <title>MSc Thesis: Evaluation of Medical Anomaly Detection Methods on Multiple Modalities</title>
      <link>https://aim-lab.io/theses/anomaly_study/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;description&#34;&gt;Description&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The medical domain is characterized by large amounts of available data, but obtaining labels usually requires expert radiologists. The recent surge of unsupervised learning spawned valuable techniques to handle data without the necessity of these labels.
Anomaly Detection tries to find data points that deviate from a statistical norm. This is especially useful in the medical domain as anomalies here are often indicators for diseases.
Recently, multiple anomaly detection and segmentation methods have been compared in a comparative study by Baur et al. [1]. However, these methods have only been evaluated on FLAIR brain MR images. This modality is not well suited to evaluate anomaly detection, because, as we recently demonstrated, all methods in this study cn be outperformed via simple thresholding [2].&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MSc Thesis: Unsupervised deep learning for vessel segmentation in optical coherence tomography angiographs</title>
      <link>https://aim-lab.io/theses/octa/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is an imaging technique that visualizes blood vessels by detecting motion of red blood cells in sequential scans [1]. It has seen initial adoption for the diagnosis and monitoring of clinical conditions that affect the retinal vasculature, such as several different eye diseases or multiple sclerosis [2, 3]. However, its effective clinical use is often impeded by the occurrence of imaging artifacts and lack of tools that can extract the vessel maps from the images. Only few studies have explored the use of deep-learning-based segmentation to delineate vessels in two-dimensional OCTA images [4, 5]. The development of three-dimensional (3D) segmentation algorithms has proven difficult due to a lack of publicly available datasets with ground truth annotations, which are difficult and time-consuming to acquire for the large and complex OCTA images [5].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project aims at tackling the problem of 3D vessel segmentation in OCTA images using unsupervised and weakly supervised deep learning. The prospective student will adopt existing deep-learning-based segmentation algorithms so that these can be trained using self-supervision and noisy annotations. All developed methods will be evaluated on a large dataset of OCTA images collected at the Klinikum rechts der Isar.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MSc Thesis: Prediction of long-term cognitive outcome in Stroke patients using machine learning</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Machine learning, in particular deep learning, has reformed the research in the field of medical imaging, and the focus of this project will be on its use for the prediction of disease progression/ neurological outcome in stroke patients. Stroke patients have a high risk of developing dementia (incidence around 20%) within a few months after the event, but so far the reasons and mechanisms are poorly understood [1]. Clinical parameters, such as age, smoking habit and previous health conditions have an influence, but are not sufficient to reliably predict the cognitive outcome. Imaging, for example magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), becomes increasingly important.
The objective of this thesis is to develop a learning-based pipeline, and investigate and identify imaging biomarkers from structural and diffusion MRI to predict poststroke dementia.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MSc Thesis: Machine Learning for Analysis of Sarcoma</title>
      <link>https://aim-lab.io/theses/sarcoma/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 10 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;description&#34;&gt;Description&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early diagnosis of musculoskeletal tumours is crucial for successful therapy and treatment. The sooner a potential malignant growth is detected, the more effective the next steps in therapy and the better a prognosis usually becomes. The rarity of musculoskeletal tumours, potentially inexperienced clinicians with this certain entity, as well as unspecific anamnesis and clinical manifestations may delay the final diagnosis. Whereas currently available imaging modalities yield considerable insights into tumour staging and grading, biopsy remains the gold standard for final diagnosis. Yet, the planning of a successful biopsy yielding sufficient material might require time aside from a high level of experience and may delay the final diagnosis even further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complexity in conjunction with multimodal approaches in fully grasping this disease provide a very suitable foundation for modern artificial intelligence algorithms. Not only for diagnostic purposes, but also for treatment planning or prognosis prediction, machine learning and deep learning algorithms are popular techniques in many disciplines at this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;tasks&#34;&gt;Tasks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Various topics in the domain of musculoskeletal tumor analysis are available for a master thesis in computer science and can be discussed during an interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main tasks will involve:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Analysis of sarcoma with machine/deep learning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coping with very limited and unbalanced datasets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adaption to medicine specific issues with AI&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>MSc Thesis: Transformer-based Optical Flow Estimation in General Computer Vision</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;description&#34;&gt;Description&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deep learning has reached a new era in 2021, with Transformer-based networks making a name for themselves in Computer vision tasks, topping the Leaderboard in Recognition, Detection and Segmentation [1-3]. However, the power of Transformers has not been researched in optical flow estimation. Based on our current knowledge about optical flow and Transformers, we believe that Transformer has the potential to surpass the state-of-the-art convolution-based networks like [4-6] in the field of flow estimation. During this project, you will develop a brand new transformer-based neural network aiming at solving the flow estimation problem, and test them on leading benchmarks like Sintel [7] and KITTI [8]. Are you ready for this challenge?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;we-offer&#34;&gt;We offer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A warm start of the project with the state-of-the-art knowledge of the group in this field&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A chance to collaborate with international experts in Deep learning who have connected with our lab&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A chance to publish if the work shines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;we-expect-you-have&#34;&gt;We expect you have&lt;/h2&gt;

      <title>MSc Thesis: Deep Natural Language Processing for Radiology Reports</title>
      <link>https://aim-lab.io/theses/nlp/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In recent years deep learning has proven quite successful in the field of natural language processing (NLP). However, many of today’s NLP models require very large datasets for training, thus self-supervised pre-training (like BERT [1]) on large unlabeled datasets has become quite important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to apply deep NLP models (like transformers) to radiology reports and do predictions on them. While there is a large variety of pre-trained models available which we could utilize for this task (like [2,3]), these models suffer from a language domain-shift when directly applied to German radiology reports as available models are typically not pre-trained on German medical language.
Thus, our goal is to pre-train a NLP model for the domain of German radiology reports such that the resulting model can be easily fine-tuned for prediction tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We offer flexibility regarding the objectives of this MSc thesis.
Possible tasks may include but are not limited to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Domain adaptation of pre-trained models&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adaption or development of a pre-training strategy for radiology reports&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Development of a model architecture for radiology reports&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Development of a data augmentation strategy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Utilization of additional data sources for pre-training (e.g. Wikipedia or books)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can define the topic of your thesis, such that it matches your interests as good as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the great success of our on-going seminar on Deep Learning for Medical Applications, we would like to discuss advanced topics that are quite relevant to Federated Learning which becomes an interesting and hot research direction in the community. In simple words, Federated Learning enables training models at the client-side while preserving their privacy, and aggregates the knowledge from the nodes to learn a global model. The interesting part here that the data are kept private and not transmitted to any other nodes. Instead, the characteristics (e.g. parameters) of the global model are shared with the clients, and once the training is done locally, the characteristics are sent back to the global one for aggregation. This learning paradigm has been received quite nicely in the community, in particular, for sensitive domains, e.g. Healthcare. To push this momentum, we proposed, together with our academia and industry partners, a workshop on Federated, Collaborative, and Distributed Learning in the International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer-Aided Intervention (MICCAI) to attract significant contributions attacking the challenges in Medical Imaging and Healthcare. In this seminar, we will be discussing the relevant papers on Federated Learning with an emphasis on the papers tackling the common challenges in Medical Imaging, e.g. data heterogeneity, domain shift, and non-iid distributed data.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Fetal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has become increasingly important to assess the development of the fetal brain. However, the acquisition is challenging due to the uncontrollable fetal motion. This requires both improved MR acquisition and reconstruction procedures. The objective of this thesis is to develop a learning-based reconstruction pipeline to reconstruct and monitor the fetal heartbeat and to investigate how we can transfer knowledge from adult cardiac MRI reconstruction to fetal cardiac MRI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MSc Thesis: Motion-Compensated MRI Reconstruction</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Long acquisition times in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) bear the risk of patient motion, which substantially degrades the image quality. Further sources of image degradation are physiological motion, such as periodic respiratory and cardiac motion. Accelerated acquisitions can compensate for the motion. The motion information can also be derived from the acquired MRI data retrospectively and used as a correction step in image reconstruction. The objective of this thesis is to include the motion model directly in MRI reconstruction using both knowledge of the acquisition physics and machine learning. Motion-Compensated MRI reconstruction offers a wide range of opportunities for projects, where we can set the emphasis based on your interests. Please get in touch with us to find an individual topic!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Machine learning has evolved tremendously to accelerate the inherently low acquisition process of Magnetic Resonance (MR) images. However, it is challenging to obtain ground truth data for learning MRI reconstruction. The objective of this MSc thesis is to explore self-supervised learning for MRI reconstruction, where only the measurement (k-space) data and knowledge about the acquisition physics are available. The tasks are to get an overview of the field (literature review), to test existing methods, and to develop novel methods on MRI data.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MSc Thesis: Distributionally robust neural networks in medical imaging</title>
      <link>https://aim-lab.io/theses/robust/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Deep learning has revolutionized the field of medical imaging. However, the performance of a model drops when the distribution of the test data is different from the distribution of the training data. This is especially critical in a medical setting, where the amount of labelled training data is often limited, and in particular for the application in clinical routine, where the distribution of the test data cannot be controlled. Typical problems are here domain shift, bias in the training data and out-of-distribution samples (e.g., pathologies, image artefacts).
In this project, we will explore distributionally robust optimization (DRO) [1,2] for deep learning in medical imaging. Instead of minimizing the average loss of a training set, DRO minimizes the worst-case risk and with this optimizes the performances on ”hard” examples. The student will adapt and develop novel methods using DRO for medical imaging applications (classification, segmentation and/or registration.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MSc Thesis: Out-of-distribution detection using contrastive training for medical imaging</title>
      <link>https://aim-lab.io/theses/oodd/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Deep learning has revolutionized the field of medical imaging. However, the performance of a model drops when the distribution of the test data is different from the distribution of the training data. This is especially critical in a medical setting, where the amount of labelled training data is often limited, and in particular for the application in clinical routine, where the distribution of the test data cannot be controlled. The automatic detection of such Out-of-Distribution (OoD) samples at inference is important for the design of reliable models, but also to identify poor quality images and pathologies not seen during training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, contrastive learning has shown to provide state-of-the-art results for OoD in image classification benchmarks [1]. Contrastive learning is an approach to formulate the task of finding similar and dissimilar samples during training. One advantage of the proposed method is that no OoD data is required during training.
The aim of this project is to explore OoD detection in deep learning in general, and in particular the use of contrastive training. The student will develop and implement (novel) methods for image classification, segmentation, and/or registration in a medical application.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Privacy-preserving artificial intelligence techniques such as differential privacy, encryption and multi-party computation can reconcile the needs for data utilisation and data protection in the medical domain, as mandated by legal and ethical requirements. Their widespread utilisation requires innovations in the fields of distributed machine learning (federated learning) as well as answering open questions in privacy research and cryptography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are seeking an MSc candidate with a strong background in machine learning, preferrably with previous exposure to medical imaging topics to complete their thesis at our institute. Experience with distributed systems, privacy and security issues or cryptology is desirable.
We are offering an engaging work environment, a large, diverse team, close personal supervision and collaboration with AI, medical and privacy-preserving ML experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can accommodate a wide range of interests from your side! Please get in touch with us to find an appropriate topic. We are also able to supervise guided research projects, smaller in scope than full MSc theses.&lt;/p&gt;
