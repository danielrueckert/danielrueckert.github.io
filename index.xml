      <title>MSc Thesis: Contrastive Pre-Training for Radiology Reports</title>
      <link>https://aim-lab.io/theses/report_pretraining/</link>

      <description>In recent years transformer-based language models have proven quite successful in the field of natural language processing (NLP). These models require huge amounts of training data and are therefore typically pre-trained on unlabelled datasets using self-supervised objectives like masked language modelling (MLM) as proposed in BERT [1].</description>

      <guid>https://aim-lab.io/theses/report_generation/</guid>
      <description>In clinical practice, medical experts like radiologists routinely write radiology reports for chest X-rays. Report generation models [1, 2, 3] try to generate such reports automatically given only the chest X-ray images without the need for human intervention.</description>

      <guid>https://aim-lab.io/theses/attacks/</guid>
      <description>Collaborative machine learning has became the new paradigm-of-choice when it comes to training deep learning models in many fields, including medical image analysis. Due to a number of data protection and governance regulations being introduced, direct data sharing for such training is rendered problematic.</description>

      <description>Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is an imaging technique that visualizes blood vessels by detecting motion of red blood cells in sequential scans [1]. It has seen initial adoption for the diagnosis and monitoring of clinical conditions that affect the retinal vasculature, such as several different eye diseases or multiple sclerosis [2, 3].</description>

      <title>MSc Thesis: Machine Learning in Fetal MRI Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://aim-lab.io/theses/old/fetal/</link>

      <guid>https://aim-lab.io/theses/old/fetal/</guid>
      <description>Fetal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has become increasingly important to assess the development of the fetal brain. However, the acquisition is challenging due to the uncontrollable fetal motion. This requires both improved MR acquisition and reconstruction procedures.</description>

      <guid>https://aim-lab.io/theses/old/motionmri/</guid>
      <description>Long acquisition times in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) bear the risk of patient motion, which substantially degrades the image quality. Further sources of image degradation are physiological motion, such as periodic respiratory and cardiac motion.</description>

      <title>MSc Thesis: Physics-Driven Self-Supervised Learning in MRI Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://aim-lab.io/theses/old/physicsmri/</link>

      <guid>https://aim-lab.io/theses/old/physicsmri/</guid>
      <description>Machine learning has evolved tremendously to accelerate the inherently low acquisition process of Magnetic Resonance (MR) images. However, it is challenging to obtain ground truth data for learning MRI reconstruction. The objective of this MSc thesis is to explore self-supervised learning for MRI reconstruction, where only the measurement (k-space) data and knowledge about the acquisition physics are available.</description>
