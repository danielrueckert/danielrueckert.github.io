      <title>MSc Thesis: Distributionally robust neural networks in medical imaging</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Deep learning has revolutionized the field of medical imaging. However, the performance of a model drops when the distribution of the test data is different from the distribution of the training data. This is especially critical in a medical setting, where the amount of labelled training data is often limited, and in particular for the application in clinical routine, where the distribution of the test data cannot be controlled. Typical problems are here domain shift, bias in the training data and out-of-distribution samples (e.g., pathologies, image artefacts).
In this project, we will explore distributionally robust optimization (DRO) [1,2] for deep learning in medical imaging. Instead of minimizing the average loss of a training set, DRO minimizes the worst-case risk and with this optimizes the performances on ”hard” examples. The student will adapt and develop novel methods using DRO for medical imaging applications (classification, segmentation and/or registration.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MSc Thesis: Out-of-distribution detection using contrastive training for medical imaging</title>
      <link>https://aim-lab.io/theses/oodd/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Deep learning has revolutionized the field of medical imaging. However, the performance of a model drops when the distribution of the test data is different from the distribution of the training data. This is especially critical in a medical setting, where the amount of labelled training data is often limited, and in particular for the application in clinical routine, where the distribution of the test data cannot be controlled. The automatic detection of such Out-of-Distribution (OoD) samples at inference is important for the design of reliable models, but also to identify poor quality images and pathologies not seen during training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, contrastive learning has shown to provide state-of-the-art results for OoD in image classification benchmarks [1]. Contrastive learning is an approach to formulate the task of finding similar and dissimilar samples during training. One advantage of the proposed method is that no OoD data is required during training.
The aim of this project is to explore OoD detection in deep learning in general, and in particular the use of contrastive training. The student will develop and implement (novel) methods for image classification, segmentation, and/or registration in a medical application.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MSc Thesis: Applied Federated Deep Learning in Medical Imaging</title>
      <link>https://aim-lab.io/theses/applied_fedl/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Distributed deep learning systems can help ascertain data governance and sovereignty while allowing the training of algorithms on larger an more diverse datasets. This is particularly beneficial in the medical domain, in which the collection and curation of large datasets is especially difficult.
Among the challenges of federated learning are issues related to data quality and representativeness, data curation, model fairness, computational performance as well as unsolved questions of data security and privacy protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are seeking an MSc candidate with a strong background in machine learning, preferrably with previous exposure to medical imaging topics to complete their thesis at our institute. Experience with distributed systems, privacy and security issues or cryptology is desirable.
We are offering an engaging work environment, a large, diverse team, close personal supervision and collaboration with AI, medical and privacy-preserving ML experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can accommodate a wide range of interests from your side! Please get in touch with us to find an appropriate topic.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Privacy-preserving artificial intelligence techniques such as differential privacy, encryption and multi-party computation can reconcile the needs for data utilisation and data protection in the medical domain, as mandated by legal and ethical requirements. Their widespread utilisation requires innovations in the fields of distributed machine learning (federated learning) as well as answering open questions in privacy research and cryptography.&lt;/p&gt;
