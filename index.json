The diagnosis and monitoring of periodontitis is mainly based on imaging modalities exhibiting ionizing radiation: X-ray (panoramic radiography) and cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). Recent studies report the successful use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the application of periodontitis diagnosis [1]. Two MRI sequences were developed: a T1-weighted sequence to visualise osseous tissue, and a T2-weighted sequence to visualise the periodontal lesion. To enable automatic diagnosis and monitoring of the disease, accurate segmentations of several anatomical structures, such as the mandibular bone, the alveolar nerve and the periodontal lesion are of utmost importance.\nThe objective of this project is the multi-modal segmentation of mandibular bone, alveolar nerve and periodontal lesions in MRI images.

Stroke patients have a high risk of developing dementia (incidence around 20%) within a few months after the event, but so far the reasons and mechanisms are poorly understood [1]. Clinical parameters, such as age, smoking habit and previous health conditions have an influence, but are not sufficient to reliably predict the cognitive outcome. Imaging, for example magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), becomes increasingly important. Recently, we have developed a novel method to predict cognitive outcome after a stroke with a balanced accuracy of 80% [2]. One drawback of the current model is that is relies on a complex preprocessing pipeline, including image registration and semi-automatic segmentation, which hinders its usefullness in clinical routine.\nThe objective of this project is to develop a fully automatic end-to-end pipeline for cognitive outcome prediction in stroke patients. This will include (i) automating the segmentations using state-of-the-art learning-based segmentation methods, (ii) identifying the most influential preprocessing steps, and (iii) development of a functioning fully automatic pipeline for easy usability by clinicians and neurologists.\nRequirements  Prior experience and good understanding in machine learning and statistics.

Its strength lies in training networks to solve a context-matching task using multiple views of an image. If the views are smartly chosen through proper augmentations, the model learns informative representations of data without any human supervision. These representations can then be used on targeted downstream tasks.\nContrastive learning has been explored extensively in the natural image domain but there still remain many unanswered questions and untapped potential in the medical domain. The unique characteristics of medical data offers many avenues to explore to try and determine how best to adapt contrastive learning to medical imaging. In this project, we are interested in the temporal dimension in two very large medical datasets.\nOur main application will be for learning representations of the evolution of progressive diseases. Despite being the leading cause of blindness in the elderly, little is understood about how Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) develops over time.

Privacy in deep learning, however, still comes at a high privacy-utility trade-off that restricts the practical usability of models trained under DP. We, as researchers, try to solve this issue by looking into learning theory and by developing novel approaches that allow DP networks to challenge non-private approaches in clinical application.\nTwo properties that affect all differentially private networks are model size and the chosen privacy parameters during training. In this work, we plan to analyze these two areas and introduce changes to the training regime, that improve not only the performance of the models but also reduce their computational overhead. The goal is to 1) build on top of research done on learning sparse neural networks and correspondingly adapt the model parameters during training [2]. And 2), we look at the amount of total noise added during training with DP and evaluate, how to adapt the corresponding privacy parameters without any knowledge about the model or dataset [3].

This additional inductive bias allows the model to learn more robust and general features from less data, rendering them highly promising for application in the medical domain. So far, however, nobody has investigated how their beneficial characteristics impact the design and scaling of deep learning model architectures.\nWe have developed a framework for initial investigation of equivariant convolutions and now want to evaluate how their performance can be further increased with larger model sizes and under different training regimes. This work plans to build onto previous highly impactful research on model design, such as the establishment of the EfficientNet architecture and the Chinchilla language model, to create a sound basis for the further consolidation of equivariant convolutions in the broader research landscape [2, 3].

In past decades, a large variety of image denoising methods employing neural networks were proposed to solve this inverse problem. These methods are major in the spatial domain which denoise the image straightforwardly by extracting the spatial information using the sliding CNN window. On the other hand, image denoising from the frequency domain also has a long history in which the low-pass filter techniques are applied and the noise (major in high-frequency space) can be filtered out. The denoising optimization in the frequency domain is frequently utilized in medical image reconstruction. Recently a great number of frequency networks with CNNs are used in this field to improve the reconstruction quality. However, this approach is rarely studied in the nature denoising field with RGB images. More recently, the advent of Transformers evolutes the computer vision field. Its inherent attributes like larger receptive field and lower inductive bias facilitate the image denoising tasks. In this work, we attempt to introduce a hybrid image denoising network that optimizes the noise image from both spatial and frequency domain.

These involve anonymization of patient data, drafting of data sharing agreements, and the approval of the corresponding ethics commission. This complex publication process is one of the key reasons for data shortage in medical domain and is often preventing machine learning approaches to reach their full potential. Federated learning [1] paired with differential privacy [2,3] can circumvent the problem of data publication. Rather than gathering the data from clinical sites to centrally train a machine learning model, the model is distributed to the different sites, locally trained on the (partial) data, and finally, globally aggregated [2]. Thus, patient data is never seen by third parties.\nWe want to construct a proof of concept for a federated learning approach in the domain of fetal MRI segmentation. An existing baseline segmentation model must be modified and embedded in a federated learning environment. The model must then be trained on fetal MRI scans located on several international clinic servers. Furthermore, sufficient privacy standards (e.g. differential privacy [2]) must be discussed and ensured.\nYour qualifications:  advanced knowledge in machine learning and computer vision (experience in federated learning or differential privacy is helpful but not mandatory) good programming skills in Python and a deep learning framework (previous work is based on PyTorch). good communication skills.

It has seen initial adoption for the diagnosis and monitoring of clinical conditions that affect the retinal vasculature, such as several different eye diseases or multiple sclerosis [2, 3]. However, its effective clinical use is often impeded by the occurrence of imaging artifacts and lack of tools that can extract the vessel maps from the images. Only few studies have explored the use of deep-learning-based segmentation to delineate vessels in two-dimensional OCTA images [4, 5]. The development of three-dimensional (3D) segmentation algorithms has proven difficult due to a lack of publicly available datasets with ground truth annotations, which are difficult and time-consuming to acquire for the large and complex OCTA images [5].\nThis project aims at tackling the problem of 3D vessel segmentation in OCTA images using unsupervised and weakly supervised deep learning. The prospective student will adopt existing deep-learning-based segmentation algorithms so that these can be trained using self-supervision and noisy annotations. All developed methods will be evaluated on a large dataset of OCTA images collected at the Klinikum rechts der Isar.\n Your qualifications:  Enthusiasm for deep learning and biomedical imaging.

The rarity of musculoskeletal tumours, potentially inexperienced clinicians with this certain entity, as well as unspecific anamnesis and clinical manifestations may delay the final diagnosis. Whereas currently available imaging modalities yield considerable insights into tumour staging and grading, biopsy remains the gold standard for final diagnosis. Yet, the planning of a successful biopsy yielding sufficient material might require time aside from a high level of experience and may delay the final diagnosis even further.\nThe complexity in conjunction with multimodal approaches in fully grasping this disease provide a very suitable foundation for modern artificial intelligence algorithms.

In this paper we present an automated and robust pipeline to minimally pre-process highly confounded neonatal resting-state fMRI data, robustly, with low failure rates and high quality-assurance. The pipeline has been designed to specifically address the challenges that neonatal data presents including low and variable contrast and high levels of head motion. We provide a detailed description and evaluation of the pipeline which includes integrated slice-to-volume motion correction and dynamic susceptibility distortion correction, a robust multimodal registration approach, bespoke ICA-based denoising, and an automated QC framework. We assess these components on a large cohort of dHCP subjects and demonstrate that processing refinements integrated into the pipeline provide substantial reduction in movement related distortions, resulting in significant improvements in SNR, and detection of high quality RSNs from neonates.","tags":[],"title":"The developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP) automated resting-state functional processing framework for newborn infants","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Veronika Zimmer"],"categories":null,"content":"Deep learning has revolutionized the field of medical imaging.

The automatic detection of such Out-of-Distribution (OoD) samples at inference is important for the design of reliable models, but also to identify poor quality images and pathologies not seen during training.\nRecently, contrastive learning has shown to provide state-of-the-art results for OoD in image classification benchmarks [1]. Contrastive learning is an approach to formulate the task of finding similar and dissimilar samples during training. One advantage of the proposed method is that no OoD data is required during training. The aim of this project is to explore OoD detection in deep learning in general, and in particular the use of contrastive training.

Many of these approaches are based on either mathematical, physical, or biological models. A challenge for these approaches is the modeling of the underlying processes (e.g., the physics of image acquisition or the patho-physiology of a disease) with appropriate levels of detail and realism. With the availability of large amounts of imaging data and machine learning (in particular deep learning) techniques, data-driven approaches have become more widespread for use in different tasks in reconstruction, analysis, and interpretation. These approaches learn statistical models directly from labeled or unlabeled image data and have been shown to be very powerful for extracting clinically useful information from medical imaging. While these data-driven approaches often outperform traditional model-based approaches, their clinical deployment often poses challenges in terms of robustness, generalization ability, and interpretability. In this article, we discuss what developments have motivated the shift from model-based approaches toward data-driven strategies and what potential problems are associated with the move toward purely data-driven approaches, in particular deep learning. We also discuss some of the open challenges for data-driven approaches, e.g., generalization to new unseen data (e.g., transfer learning), robustness to adversarial attacks, and interpretability. Finally, we conclude with a discussion on how these approaches may lead to the development of more closely coupled imaging pipelines that are optimized in an end-to-end fashion.","tags":[],"title":"Model-Based and Data-Driven Strategies in Medical Image Computing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["g. a. kaissis","m. r. makowski","d. rueckert and r. f. braren"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1602478755,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1602478755,"objectID":"64465c564401754b85a2e498011d16a7","permalink":"https://aim-lab.io/www.nature.com/articles/s42256-020-0186-1","publishdate":"2020-10-12T06:59:15+02:00","relpermalink":"/www.nature.com/articles/s42256-020-0186-1","section":"publication","summary":"The broad application of artificial intelligence techniques in medicine is currently hindered by limited dataset availability for algorithm training and validation, due to the absence of standardized electronic medical records, and strict legal and ethical requirements to protect patient privacy.

We identified 16 significant loci that contain genes associated with haemodynamic phenotypes and regulation of cytoskeletal arborization3,4. Using biomechanical simulations and observational data from human participants, we demonstrate that trabecular morphology is an important determinant of cardiac performance. Through genetic association studies with cardiac disease phenotypes and Mendelian randomization, we find a causal relationship between trabecular morphology and risk of cardiovascular disease. These findings suggest a previously unknown role for myocardial trabeculae in the function of the adult heart, identify conserved pathways that regulate structural complexity and reveal the influence of the myocardial trabeculae on susceptibility to cardiovascular disease.","tags":[],"title":"Genetic and functional insights into the fractal structure of the heart","type":"publication"}]
