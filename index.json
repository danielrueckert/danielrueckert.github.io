State-of-the-art approaches to image segmentation [5], while very accurate, have limitations in terms of topological correctness. Topological losses are being investigated to overcome these challenges; for example, CL-Dice [4] introduced a loss based on a differentiable soft skeleton for vessel segmentation. In this work we seek to extend this approach to more complex objects, using the medial axis.\nThe medial axis refers to the set of points inside a shape that are equidistant from at least two boundary points of the shape. It can be thought of as a skeletal representation of the shape, which simplifies its structure while preserving essential geometric and topological properties. Approximating the medial axis efficiently and robustly is an active topic of research [1, 2, 3].\nIn this project you will implement in Python / adapt from other frameworks the medial axis computation and evaluate its feasibility as a loss in a segmentation problem. You will be working in a state-of-the-art research project with opportunities to bring in you own research ideas. We are looking for a highly motivated student with a solid background in computer graphics and experience in C++, in addition to experience in PyTorch. We will provide access to necessary hardware.\n How to apply Please send your CV and transcript to Alina Dima (alina.dima@tum.de) and Suprosanna Shit (suprosanna.shit@uzh.ch) using the subject “MSc Thesis: Medial axis-based segmentation loss”.\nPlease also include brief summaries of your prior deep learning projects (including your contributions to the project and the used framework) and, if available, provide links to the codebases (e.g., your GitHub profile).\n References [1] Yan, Y., Letscher, D., \u0026amp; Ju, T.

Pretraining with contrastive learning enables models to extract robust and generalisable features from natural image datasets, facilitating label-efficient downstream image analysis. However, the direct application of conventional contrastive methods to medical datasets introduces two domain-specific issues. Firstly, several image transformations which have been shown to be crucial for effective contrastive learning do not translate from the natural image to the medical image domain. Secondly, the assumption made by conventional methods, that any two images are dissimilar, is systematically misleading in medical datasets depicting the same anatomy and disease. This is exacerbated in longitudinal image datasets that repeatedly image the same patient cohort to monitor their disease progression over time. In this paper we tackle these issues by extending conventional contrastive frameworks with a novel metadata-enhanced strategy. Our approach employs widely available patient metadata to approximate the true set of inter-image contrastive relationships. To this end we employ records for patient identity, eye position (i.e. left or right) and time series information. In experiments using two large longitudinal datasets containing 170,427 retinal optical coherence tomography (OCT) images of 7912 patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD), we evaluate the utility of using metadata to incorporate the temporal dynamics of disease progression into pretraining. Our metadata-enhanced approach outperforms both standard contrastive methods and a retinal image foundation model in five out of six image-level downstream tasks related to AMD. We find benefits in both a low-data and high-data regime across tasks ranging from AMD stage and type classification to prediction of visual acuity. Due to its modularity, our method can be quickly and cost-effectively tested to establish the potential benefits of including available metadata in contrastive pretraining.","tags":[],"title":"Metadata-enhanced contrastive learning from retinal optical coherence tomography images.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Márton Szép"],"categories":null,"content":"Description: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown exceptional capabilities in understanding and generating human-like text.

The focus will be to thoroughly analyse and expand a framework for equivariant models already developed at our lab. This includes getting familiar with model architectures in general, the properties of equivariant convolutions and the intersection of the two.

Privacy-enhancing technologies, such as differential privacy (DP), aim to circumvent these susceptibilities. DP is the strongest possible protection for training models while bounding the risks of inferring the inclusion of training samples or reconstructing the original data. DP achieves this by setting a quantifiable privacy budget. Although a lower budget decreases the risk of information leakage, it typically also reduces the performance of such models. This imposes a trade-off between robust performance and stringent privacy. Additionally, the interpretation of a privacy budget remains abstract and challenging to contextualize. Here we contrast the performance of artificial intelligence models at various privacy budgets against both theoretical risk bounds and empirical success of reconstruction attacks. We show that using very large privacy budgets can render reconstruction attacks impossible, while drops in performance are negligible. We thus conclude that not using DP at all is negligent when applying artificial intelligence models to sensitive data. We deem our results to lay a foundation for further debates on striking a balance between privacy risks and model performance.","tags":[],"title":"Reconciling privacy and accuracy in AI for medical imaging.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Daniel Rückert"],"categories":[],"content":"We are very excited that our paper “SINR: Spline-enhanced implicit neural representation for multi-modal registration” won got the best oral award in MIDL 2024!

However, while LLMs have achieved excellent performance on medical licensing exams, these tests fail to assess many skills that are necessary for deployment in a realistic clinical decision making environment, including gathering information, adhering to established guidelines, and integrating into clinical workflows. To understand how useful LLMs are in real-world settings, we must evaluate them in the wild, i.e. on real-world data under realistic conditions. Here we have created a curated dataset based on the MIMIC-IV database spanning 2400 real patient cases and four common abdominal pathologies as well as a framework to simulate a realistic clinical setting. We show that current state-of-the-art LLMs do not accurately diagnose patients across all pathologies (performing significantly worse than physicians on average), follow neither diagnostic nor treatment guidelines, and cannot interpret laboratory results, thus posing a serious risk to the health of patients. Furthermore, we move beyond diagnostic accuracy and demonstrate that they cannot be easily integrated into existing workflows because they often fail to follow instructions and are sensitive to both the quantity and order of information. Overall, our analysis reveals that LLMs are currently not ready for clinical deployment while providing a dataset and framework to guide future studies.","tags":[],"title":"Evaluating and mitigating limitations of large language models in clinical decision making.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alexander Ziller"],"categories":null,"content":"In this course students are given the chance to apply their abilities and knowledge in deep learning to real-world medical data.

The proposed architecture puts citizens in control by storing personal health data on a combination of personal devices rather than in centralised data silos. We describe how this federated architecture fits within the EHDS and can enable the same features as centralised systems while protecting the privacy of citizens. We further argue that increased privacy and control do not contradict the use of electronic health data for research and development. Instead, data sovereignty and transparency encourage active participation in studies and data sharing.

One constraint is that biologically important features can be masked by high levels of technical noise in the data. Here we introduce a replicate-based method for deep learning from chromatin conformation contact maps. Using a Siamese network configuration our approach learns to distinguish technical noise from biological variation and outperforms image similarity metrics across a range of biological systems. The features extracted from Hi-C maps after perturbation of cohesin and CTCF reflect the distinct biological functions of cohesin and CTCF in the formation of domains and boundaries, respectively. The learnt distance metrics are biologically meaningful, as they mirror the density of cohesin and CTCF binding.

Consequently, clinical decision making is centered on accurate knowledge of timing and often requires a radiologist to interpret Computed Tomography (CT) of the brain to confirm the occurrence and age of an event. These tasks are particularly challenging due to the subtle expression of acute ischemic lesions and the dynamic nature of their appearance. Automation efforts have not yet applied deep learning to estimate lesion age and treated these two tasks independently, so, have overlooked their inherent complementary relationship. To leverage this, we propose a novel end-to-end multi-task transformer-based network optimized for concurrent segmentation and age estimation of cerebral ischemic lesions. By utilizing gated positional self-attention and CT-specific data augmentation, the proposed method can capture long-range spatial dependencies while maintaining its ability to be trained from scratch under low-data regimes commonly found in medical imaging. Furthermore, to better combine multiple predictions, we incorporate uncertainty by utilizing quantile loss to facilitate estimating a probability density function of lesion age. The effectiveness of our model is then extensively evaluated on a clinical dataset consisting of 776 CT images from two medical centers. Experimental results demonstrate that our method obtains promising performance, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.933 for classifying lesion ages less than 4.5 hours compared to 0.858 using a conventional approach, and outperforms task-specific state-of-the-art algorithms.

Current state-of-the art methods focus on estimating dense pixel-/voxel-wise motion fields in image space, which ignores the fact that motion estimation is only relevant and useful within the anatomical objects of interest, e.g., the heart. In this work, we model the heart as a 3D mesh consisting of epi- and endocardial surfaces. We propose a novel learning framework, DeepMesh, which propagates a template heart mesh to a subject space and estimates the 3D motion of the heart mesh from CMR images for individual subjects. In DeepMesh, the heart mesh of the end-diastolic frame of an individual subject is first reconstructed from the template mesh. Mesh-based 3D motion fields with respect to the end-diastolic frame are then estimated from 2D short- and long-axis CMR images. By developing a differentiable mesh-to-image rasterizer, DeepMesh is able to leverage 2D shape information from multiple anatomical views for 3D mesh reconstruction and mesh motion estimation. The proposed method estimates vertex-wise displacement and thus maintains vertex correspondences between time frames, which is important for the quantitative assessment of cardiac function across different subjects and populations. We evaluate DeepMesh on CMR images acquired from the UK Biobank. We focus on 3D motion estimation of the left ventricle in this work.

We assign a unique coordinate that consists of time, coil index, and frequency domain location to each sampled k-space point. We then learn the subject-specific mapping from these unique coordinates to k-space intensities using a multi-layer perceptron with frequency domain regularization. During inference, we obtain a complete k-space for Cartesian coordinates and an arbitrary temporal resolution. A simple inverse Fourier transform recovers the image, eliminating the need for density compensation and costly non-uniform Fourier transforms for non-Cartesian data.

To address these needs, we propose the first self-supervised contrastive learning framework that takes advantage of images and tabular data to train unimodal encoders. Our solution combines SimCLR and SCARF, two leading contrastive learning strategies, and is simple and effective. In our experiments, we demonstrate the strength of our framework by predicting risks of myocardial infarction and coronary artery disease (CAD) using cardiac MR images and 120 clinical features from 40,000 UK Biobank subjects. Furthermore, we show the generalizability of our approach to natural images using the DVM car advertisement dataset. We take advantage of the high interpretability of tabular data and through attribution and ablation experiments find that morphometric tabular features, describing size and shape, have outsized importance during the contrastive learning process and improve the quality of the learned embeddings.

In this work, we investigate the single-source domain generalization problem: training a deep network that is robust to unseen domains, under the condition that training data are only available from one source domain, which is common in medical imaging applications. We tackle this problem in the context of cross-domain medical image segmentation. In this scenario, domain shifts are mainly caused by different acquisition processes. We propose a simple causality-inspired data augmentation approach to expose a segmentation model to synthesized domain-shifted training examples. Specifically, 1) to make the deep model robust to discrepancies in image intensities and textures, we employ a family of randomly-weighted shallow networks. They augment training images using diverse appearance transformations. 2) Further we show that spurious correlations among objects in an image are detrimental to domain robustness. These correlations might be taken by the network as domain-specific clues for making predictions, and they may break on unseen domains. We remove these spurious correlations via causal intervention. This is achieved by resampling the appearances of potentially correlated objects independently. The proposed approach is validated on three cross-domain segmentation scenarios: cross-modality (CT-MRI) abdominal image segmentation, cross-sequence (bSSFP-LGE) cardiac MRI segmentation, and cross-site prostate MRI segmentation.

State-of-the-art FSS methods are typically designed for segmenting natural images and rely on abundant annotated data of training classes to learn image representations that generalize well to unseen testing classes. However, such a training mechanism is impractical in annotation-scarce medical imaging scenarios. To address this challenge, in this work, we propose a novel self-supervised FSS framework for medical images, named SSL-ALPNet, in order to bypass the requirement for annotations during training. The proposed method exploits superpixel-based pseudo-labels to provide supervision signals. In addition, we propose a simple yet effective adaptive local prototype pooling module which is plugged into the prototype networks to further boost segmentation accuracy.

The medical and financial sectors are, for example, constrained by legal, ethical, regulatory and privacy concerns preventing data sharing between institutions. Collaborative learning systems, such as federated learning, are designed to circumvent such restrictions and provide a privacy-preserving alternative by eschewing data sharing and relying instead on the distributed remote execution of algorithms. However, such systems are susceptible to malicious adversarial interference attempting to undermine their utility or divulge confidential information. Here we present an overview and analysis of current adversarial attacks and their mitigations in the context of collaborative machine learning. We discuss the applicability of attack vectors to specific learning contexts and attempt to formulate a generic foundation for adversarial influence and mitigation mechanisms. We moreover show that a number of context-specific learning conditions are exploited in similar fashion across all settings. Lastly, we provide a focused perspective on open challenges and promising areas of future research in the field.","tags":[],"title":"Adversarial interference and its mitigations in privacy-preserving collaborative machine learning.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S.

It is known that the success of AI is mostly attributed to the availability of big data with annotations for a single task and the advances in high performance computing. However, medical imaging presents unique challenges that confront deep learning approaches. In this survey paper, we first present traits of medical imaging, highlight both clinical needs and technical challenges in medical imaging, and describe how emerging trends in deep learning are addressing these issues. We cover the topics of network architecture, sparse and noisy labels, federating learning, interpretability, uncertainty quantification, etc. Then, we present several case studies that are commonly found in clinical practice, including digital pathology and chest, brain, cardiovascular, and abdominal imaging. Rather than presenting an exhaustive literature survey, we instead describe some prominent research highlights related to these case study applications. We conclude with a discussion and presentation of promising future directions.","tags":[],"title":"A Review of Deep Learning in Medical Imaging: Imaging Traits, Technology Trends, Case Studies with Progress Highlights, and Future Promises.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Q.

In the current COVID-19 pandemic, a major focus of artificial intelligence (AI) is interpreting chest CT, which can be readily used in the assessment and management of the disease. This paper demonstrates the feasibility of a federated learning method for detecting COVID-19 related CT abnormalities with external validation on patients from a multinational study. We recruited 132 patients from seven multinational different centers, with three internal hospitals from Hong Kong for training and testing, and four external, independent datasets from Mainland China and Germany, for validating model generalizability. We also conducted case studies on longitudinal scans for automated estimation of lesion burden for hospitalized COVID-19 patients. We explore the federated learning algorithms to develop a privacy-preserving AI model for COVID-19 medical image diagnosis with good generalization capability on unseen multinational datasets. Federated learning could provide an effective mechanism during pandemics to rapidly develop clinically useful AI across institutions and countries overcoming the burden of central aggregation of large amounts of sensitive data.","tags":[],"title":"Federated deep learning for detecting COVID-19 lung abnormalities in CT: A privacy-preserving multinational validation study.","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Anschrift Technische Universität München Arcisstraße 21 80333 München Umsatzsteueridentifikationsnummer: DE811193231 Zuständige Aufsichtsbehörde Bayerisches Staatsministerium für Wissenschaft und Kunst Inhaltlich verantwortlich Prof. Dr. Daniel Rückert\nTechnische Universität München / Klinikum Rechts der Isar\nLehrstuhl für Artificial Intelligence in Medicine and Healthcare\nTranslaTUM\nEinsteinstraße 25\n81675 München\nE-Mail: daniel(dot)rueckert(at)tum(dot)de\nHaftungshinweis Trotz sorgfältiger inhaltlicher Kontrolle übernehmen wir keine Haftung für die Inhalte externer Links.
