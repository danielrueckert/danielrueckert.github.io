Since the dynamics of the heart are important for analysing cardiac health, CMR imaging is the gold-standard for evidence-based diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases (leading causes of death globvally [1]). However, long scan times and high costs limit its use in clinical practice. In this project, we aim to adress this issue by enabling cardiac health analysis using cost-effective and widely available electrocardiograms (ECG) only. The objective is to learn cardiac representations with high temporal resolution from ECG, with a focus on capturing the dynamics of a single heartbeat.\nSimilar to previous works [2], we propose the integration of spatiotemporal information from CMR imaging into the representation learning process, enhancing the interpretation of ECG data. Contrastive learning techniques [3] should be leveraged to transfer information from CMR imaging to high-resolution ECG representations of a single heartbeat. To this end, strategies to extract a representative heartbeat from ECG recordings have to be investigated, considering the variation in heartbeat length within a recording. Furthermore, techniques to synchronise cardiac cycles between ECG and CMR imaging data have to be developed, accounting for the temporal offset in data acquisition.\nWe will evaluate the strength of our approach on multiple downstream tasks, including the classification of various cardiovascular diseases and regression of cardiac phenotypes solely from ECG data. Experiments on paired ECG and CMR imaging data of 40k subjects provided by the UK Biobank population study are conducted within this work.

Gone are the days when we passively absorbed health information. Today, we\u0026rsquo;re in the age of data-driven insights, where personalized health data is not just recorded but actively analyzed to provide actionable insights. ​ In MeDecode we want to embody this evolution, we are a pre-registered startup founded six months ago by an active team of three co-founders, and we are currently seeking a student to contribute to the software development efforts to create a Minimal Viable Product. Offering users an intuitive platform to monitor, compare and understand various health metrics, this project truly stands apart with its emphasis on comparative insights against other users. In the vast sea of health data, understanding one\u0026rsquo;s metrics in isolation offers limited insight. Is a heart rate of 80 bpm at rest good or bad? How does a person\u0026rsquo;s sleep pattern compare with someone of their age and lifestyle? By allowing users to compare their data against that of others, we offer a clearer, contextualized view of their health. This not only bridges the gap between mere data collection and genuine understanding but also creates a more engaging and motivating user experience. ​ However, with the power of comparative insights comes a significant responsibility: ensuring user privacy and data anonymization. Firstly, it serves to protect user identity, ensuring that while data can be compared, individual identities remain concealed. Secondly, when users are aware that their data is anonymized, they are more inclined to report honestly, leading to more accurate and reliable comparative insights. Lastly, in the unfortunate event of a data breach, the anonymization of data drastically reduces its value to malicious actors, as it can\u0026rsquo;t be linked back to specific individuals, thereby minimizing potential harm. ​\nYour qualifications ​ We are actively seeking an enthusiastic Master\u0026rsquo;s student, preferably majoring in Computer Science, Information Systems, or Health Informatics.

The aim of anonymization is to protect the privacy of individuals whose data is being collected and processed. However, anonymizing data is not sufficient to guarantee privacy protection. Research has shown that data samples can easily re-identified through a variety of approaches as simply as combining a dataset with other data sources, e.g. publicly available information [1]. This poses a problem for data sharing, especially in highly sensitive domains such as medicine.\nSynthetic data allows to generate new examples that preserve the statistical properties of the original data [2]. In a medical use case, synthetic data could be used to generate realistic but entirely artificial medical records. These synthetic medical records can be used for a variety of different purposes, such as augmenting existing datasets or sharing data without revealing any patient information [3].\nFor the later, however, synthetic data doesn\u0026rsquo;t per se protect the privacy of individual patients. To achieve privacy preservation, we have to apply additional techniques such as differential privacy [4]. The aim of this project is to evaluate synthetic data generation with differential privacy for tabular medical records. You will first evaluate current literature of synthetic data generation for tabular data with regards to medical records [5, 6]. In the following, a data generation pipeline will be implemented and analysed to evaluate the performance of existing synthetisation approaches on a real-world multiple sclerosis dataset. The data will be used to predict disease activity and help treatment decision making for disease-modifying therapies [7]. To measure the prediction capabilities of the synthetically generated private data, its prediction performance is compared against existing baselines from the original data curated during different time intervals. Furthermore, the addition of synthetic data into the existing training process for increased model robustness will be assessed.

In this research thesis, we aim to investigate the importance of self-supervised learning techniques in harnessing large clinical datasets, where labels are expensive and scarce. Specifically, we explore two prominent self-supervised deep learning approaches: contrastive learning and masked autoencoders.\nContrastive learning [1] has gained considerable attention due to its ability to learn useful representations without requiring labeled data. However, in the context of large clinical datasets comprising radiography images of multiple anatomical regions, several challenges arise. The need for downsampling to achieve viable batch sizes, coupled with the focus on global features, might limit the effectiveness of contrastive learning, particularly for capturing fine-grained features and retaining the high-resolution information of the images.\nTo overcome these limitations, we propose the utilization of masked autoencoders [2], an alternative self-supervised learning technique, for generating strong embeddings from our extensive in-house clinical dataset consisting of over 1 million radiography images across multiple anatomical regions. Masked autoencoders excel at capturing intricate details and preserving fine-grained features due to their ability to reconstruct input data by reconstructing masked portions. This characteristic makes them well-suited for large image sizes and enables them to emphasize local, region-specific information.\nWe will evaluate the strength of our embeddings through multiple downstream tasks such as foreign object identification, bone fracture classification, and fracture detection (bounding boxes). We will use a combination of NLP and expert annotations to develop a large enough training dataset for efficient finetuning using minimal labeled data.\nTo accomplish this work successfully, we expect you to have: Strong coding skills and familiarity with Pytorch Basic knowledge of self-supervised methods such as contrastive learning or MAEs A strong spirit of independent work and desire to solve interesting, realworld research questions What we offer Access to a massive inhouse dataset of over 1 million medical images An exciting research project with many possibilities to bring in your own ideas.

The successful candidate will have access to a large-scale biomedical database and research resource, containing in-depth genetic and health information from half a million participants. The position involves designing a use case for evaluating bias, implementing machine learning models, and generating a fairness report.\nThis is an exciting opportunity for a motivated Master\u0026rsquo;s student to work on a project with real-world implications for healthcare. Additionally, there may be the possibility of publishing the results of the project in a peer-reviewed scientific journal, providing an excellent opportunity to showcase the student\u0026rsquo;s research skills and contribute to the field of healthcare AI-based algorithms.\nProject Background: Healthcare AI-based algorithms are rapidly becoming ubiquitous in medical settings, from assisting clinicians in diagnosing diseases to personalizing treatments. While AI has the potential to revolutionize healthcare, it can also perpetuate biases and lead to disparities in care. For example, an AI-based algorithm may have a higher accuracy rate for diagnosing certain diseases in specific racial or ethnic groups, leading to differential treatment and outcomes. Bias in healthcare AI-based algorithms can have serious consequences for patient care, particularly for those from marginalized or underrepresented groups.

Its strength lies in training networks to solve a context-matching task using multiple views of an image. If the views are smartly chosen through proper augmentations, the model learns informative representations of data without any human supervision. These representations can then be used on targeted downstream tasks.\nContrastive learning has been explored extensively in the natural image domain but there still remain many unanswered questions and untapped potential in the medical domain. The unique characteristics of medical data offers many avenues to explore to try and determine how best to adapt contrastive learning to medical imaging. In this project, we are interested in the temporal dimension in two very large medical datasets.\nOur main application will be for learning representations of the evolution of progressive diseases. Despite being the leading cause of blindness in the elderly, little is understood about how Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) develops over time. This evolution is documented in our dataset of 181k retinal images of 7.5k subjects imaged over eight years. Using the self-supervised methodology you develop, you will also learn representations that encode multiple years of disease progression, ultimately improving diagnosis and prognosis of AMD.\nA secondary application, to test the generalisability of the method, is cardiac MR imaging. Here we will train models to learn the dynamics of the heart as it cycles at least one heart beat, which is important for predicting cardiac disease such as infarction. The full cycle cardiac MR data from the UKBB contains over 45k subjects.\nTo accomplish this work successfully, we expect you to have: Strong coding skills and familiarity with Pytorch Basic knowledge of contrastive learning A strong spirit of independent work and desire to solve interesting research questions What we offer An exciting research project with many possibilities to bring in your own ideas.

So far, however, nobody has investigated how their beneficial characteristics impact the design and scaling of deep learning model architectures.\nWe have developed a framework for initial investigation of equivariant convolutions and now want to evaluate how their performance can be further increased with larger model sizes and under different training regimes.

Privacy in deep learning, however, still comes at a high privacy-utility trade-off that restricts the practical usability of models trained under DP. We, as researchers, try to solve this issue by looking into learning theory and by developing novel approaches that allow DP networks to challenge non-private approaches in clinical application.\nTwo properties that affect all differentially private networks are model size and the chosen privacy parameters during training. In this work, we plan to analyze these two areas and introduce changes to the training regime, that improve not only the performance of the models but also reduce their computational overhead. The goal is to 1) build on top of research done on learning sparse neural networks and correspondingly adapt the model parameters during training [2]. And 2), we look at the amount of total noise added during training with DP and evaluate, how to adapt the corresponding privacy parameters without any knowledge about the model or dataset [3].

In past decades, a large variety of image denoising methods employing neural networks were proposed to solve this inverse problem. These methods are major in the spatial domain which denoise the image straightforwardly by extracting the spatial information using the sliding CNN window. On the other hand, image denoising from the frequency domain also has a long history in which the low-pass filter techniques are applied and the noise (major in high-frequency space) can be filtered out. The denoising optimization in the frequency domain is frequently utilized in medical image reconstruction. Recently a great number of frequency networks with CNNs are used in this field to improve the reconstruction quality. However, this approach is rarely studied in the nature denoising field with RGB images. More recently, the advent of Transformers evolutes the computer vision field. Its inherent attributes like larger receptive field and lower inductive bias facilitate the image denoising tasks.

Therefore, clinical data of patients is usually securely stored on clinic servers without access from outside. Publication of clinical data is difficult and cumbersome as strict privacy and data protection laws must be obeyed. These involve anonymization of patient data, drafting of data sharing agreements, and the approval of the corresponding ethics commission. This complex publication process is one of the key reasons for data shortage in medical domain and is often preventing machine learning approaches to reach their full potential. Federated learning [1] paired with differential privacy [2,3] can circumvent the problem of data publication. Rather than gathering the data from clinical sites to centrally train a machine learning model, the model is distributed to the different sites, locally trained on the (partial) data, and finally, globally aggregated [2]. Thus, patient data is never seen by third parties.\nWe want to construct a proof of concept for a federated learning approach in the domain of fetal MRI segmentation. An existing baseline segmentation model must be modified and embedded in a federated learning environment. The model must then be trained on fetal MRI scans located on several international clinic servers. Furthermore, sufficient privacy standards (e.g. differential privacy [2]) must be discussed and ensured.\nYour qualifications: advanced knowledge in machine learning and computer vision (experience in federated learning or differential privacy is helpful but not mandatory) good programming skills in Python and a deep learning framework (previous work is based on PyTorch). good communication skills.

Diagnosis of prostate cancer is typically done by using ultrasound-guided needle biopsies. An approach that not only involves risks, due to the invasive nature of the method, but also generally underestimates the aggressiveness of the tumor [2]. Standard positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with prostate cancer specific tracers and specifically PSMA-PET have shown to be advantageous for delineating suspicious lesions during biopsy [3, 4].\nWe want to use the information provided by these PET and multi-parametric MRI images to directly predict Gleason scores that accurately report the aggressiveness of the prostate cancers without the risks associated with an invasive biopsy. Recent research at our institution has produced promising results predicting Gleason scores from handcrafted radiomic features [5]. This work aims at building on top of this research and to develop an end-to-end deep learning pipeline for predicting tumor aggressiveness directly from different imaging modalities. We have exclusive access to a dataset which includes PSMA-11 PET/MRI scans, segmentation maps and the pathological information of the tumors. Additional public data is available through the PI-CAI Challenge. The focus of this work is to build a complete pipeline for analysing multi-modal medical imaging datasets. This includes research on understanding the diverse data available, exploring different approaches for dealing with the limited dataset size (data augmentation, pre-training etc.) and finding a suitable model and evaluation metric for this use case. Your qualifications: We are looking for a highly motivated Master’s student in Computer Science, Physics, Engineering or Mathematics. You will establish a comprehensive medical imaging pipeline in PyTorch to extract information from these images. You will be working together with me and under the supervision of Prof. Daniel Rückert.

It has seen initial adoption for the diagnosis and monitoring of clinical conditions that affect the retinal vasculature, such as several different eye diseases or multiple sclerosis [2, 3]. However, its effective clinical use is often impeded by the occurrence of imaging artifacts and lack of tools that can extract the vessel maps from the images. Only few studies have explored the use of deep-learning-based segmentation to delineate vessels in two-dimensional OCTA images [4, 5]. The development of three-dimensional (3D) segmentation algorithms has proven difficult due to a lack of publicly available datasets with ground truth annotations, which are difficult and time-consuming to acquire for the large and complex OCTA images [5].\nThis project aims at tackling the problem of 3D vessel segmentation in OCTA images using unsupervised and weakly supervised deep learning. The prospective student will adopt existing deep-learning-based segmentation algorithms so that these can be trained using self-supervision and noisy annotations. All developed methods will be evaluated on a large dataset of OCTA images collected at the Klinikum rechts der Isar.\nYour qualifications: Enthusiasm for deep learning and biomedical imaging.

The rarity of musculoskeletal tumours, potentially inexperienced clinicians with this certain entity, as well as unspecific anamnesis and clinical manifestations may delay the final diagnosis. Whereas currently available imaging modalities yield considerable insights into tumour staging and grading, biopsy remains the gold standard for final diagnosis. Yet, the planning of a successful biopsy yielding sufficient material might require time aside from a high level of experience and may delay the final diagnosis even further.\nThe complexity in conjunction with multimodal approaches in fully grasping this disease provide a very suitable foundation for modern artificial intelligence algorithms. Not only for diagnostic purposes, but also for treatment planning or prognosis prediction, machine learning and deep learning algorithms are popular techniques in many disciplines at this time.\nTasks Various topics in the domain of musculoskeletal tumor analysis are available for a master thesis in computer science and can be discussed during an interview.\nThe main tasks will involve:\nAnalysis of sarcoma with machine/deep learning Coping with very limited and unbalanced datasets Adaption to medicine specific issues with AI Presenting and discussing results What we offer Access to very rare medical data Highly educated \u0026amp; interdisciplinary environment Top level hardware for scientific computing Constant feedback from medical and computer science experts Prerequisites Advanced knowledge of deep learning with imaging data Beneficial but not necessary: experience in medicine / oncology References [1] Rechl H, Kirchhoff C, Wörtler K, Lenze U, Töpfer A, von Eisenhart-Rothe R.

In this paper we present an automated and robust pipeline to minimally pre-process highly confounded neonatal resting-state fMRI data, robustly, with low failure rates and high quality-assurance. The pipeline has been designed to specifically address the challenges that neonatal data presents including low and variable contrast and high levels of head motion. We provide a detailed description and evaluation of the pipeline which includes integrated slice-to-volume motion correction and dynamic susceptibility distortion correction, a robust multimodal registration approach, bespoke ICA-based denoising, and an automated QC framework. We assess these components on a large cohort of dHCP subjects and demonstrate that processing refinements integrated into the pipeline provide substantial reduction in movement related distortions, resulting in significant improvements in SNR, and detection of high quality RSNs from neonates.","tags":[],"title":"The developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP) automated resting-state functional processing framework for newborn infants","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Veronika Zimmer"],"categories":null,"content":"Deep learning has revolutionized the field of medical imaging.

One advantage of the proposed method is that no OoD data is required during training.

Many of these approaches are based on either mathematical, physical, or biological models. A challenge for these approaches is the modeling of the underlying processes (e.g., the physics of image acquisition or the patho-physiology of a disease) with appropriate levels of detail and realism. With the availability of large amounts of imaging data and machine learning (in particular deep learning) techniques, data-driven approaches have become more widespread for use in different tasks in reconstruction, analysis, and interpretation. These approaches learn statistical models directly from labeled or unlabeled image data and have been shown to be very powerful for extracting clinically useful information from medical imaging. While these data-driven approaches often outperform traditional model-based approaches, their clinical deployment often poses challenges in terms of robustness, generalization ability, and interpretability. In this article, we discuss what developments have motivated the shift from model-based approaches toward data-driven strategies and what potential problems are associated with the move toward purely data-driven approaches, in particular deep learning. We also discuss some of the open challenges for data-driven approaches, e.g., generalization to new unseen data (e.g., transfer learning), robustness to adversarial attacks, and interpretability. Finally, we conclude with a discussion on how these approaches may lead to the development of more closely coupled imaging pipelines that are optimized in an end-to-end fashion.","tags":[],"title":"Model-Based and Data-Driven Strategies in Medical Image Computing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["G.

In medical imaging, harmonized data exchange formats such as Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine and electronic data storage are the standard, partially addressing the first issue, but the requirements for privacy preservation are equally strict. To prevent patient privacy compromise while promoting scientific research on large datasets that aims to improve patient care, the implementation of technical solutions to simultaneously address the demands for data protection and utilization is mandatory.

Here we analyzed cardiovascular magnetic resonance images from a population-based study, the UK Biobank, using an automated machine-learning-based analysis pipeline. We report a comprehensive range of structural and functional phenotypes for the heart and aorta across 26,893 participants, and explore how these phenotypes vary according to sex, age and major cardiovascular risk factors. We extended this analysis with a phenome-wide association study, in which we tested for correlations of a wide range of non-imaging phenotypes of the participants with imaging phenotypes. We further explored the associations of imaging phenotypes with early-life factors, mental health and cognitive function using both observational analysis and Mendelian randomization. Our study illustrates how population-based cardiac and aortic imaging phenotypes can be used to better define cardiovascular disease risks as well as heart–brain health interactions, highlighting new opportunities for studying disease mechanisms and developing image-based biomarkers.","tags":[],"title":"A population-based phenome-wide association study of cardiac and aortic structure and function","type":"publication"},{"authors":["H.

The function of these trabeculae in adults and their genetic architecture are unknown. Here we performed a genome-wide association study to investigate image-derived phenotypes of trabeculae using the fractal analysis of trabecular morphology in 18,096 participants of the UK Biobank. We identified 16 significant loci that contain genes associated with haemodynamic phenotypes and regulation of cytoskeletal arborization3,4. Using biomechanical simulations and observational data from human participants, we demonstrate that trabecular morphology is an important determinant of cardiac performance. Through genetic association studies with cardiac disease phenotypes and Mendelian randomization, we find a causal relationship between trabecular morphology and risk of cardiovascular disease. These findings suggest a previously unknown role for myocardial trabeculae in the function of the adult heart, identify conserved pathways that regulate structural complexity and reveal the influence of the myocardial trabeculae on susceptibility to cardiovascular disease.","tags":[],"title":"Genetic and functional insights into the fractal structure of the heart","type":"publication"}]
