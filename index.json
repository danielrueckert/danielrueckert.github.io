In practice, clinicians typically have less data, both in terms of diversity and scale, but still, wish to deploy deep learning solutions. Combined with increasing medical dataset sizes and expensive annotation costs, the necessity for unsupervised methods that can be pretrain multimodally and predict unimodally has risen.\nWe have developed a self-supervised representation learning framework that incorporates both tabular and imaging data during pretraining but requires only images during testing. So far, during pretraining we have used all possibly relevant features but have indications in the literature and through our experiments that there exists an optimal subset. Furthermore, the shared latent space should hold keys to the increased performance of the multimodal pretraining process.\nThe goal of this thesis will be to develop a framework for optimal subset selection of tabular features for pretraining. Your target is to improve the downstream performance of the imaging encoder across all tasks. At the end, we wish to understand how information is encoded between modalities when training in a multimodal fashion and how to maximize our learning signal.\nTheoretically, you will explore concepts such as mutual information, collinearity and latent space explainability. Experimentally, you will start with our network architecture and the UK Biobank dataset of over 40k cardiac MR scans to test your hypotheses. As an extension, you will use explainability methods such as Guided GradCAM and integrated gradients to investigate how the learned features change with different subsets of tabular features and why perfomance increases.\nTo accomplish this work successfully, we expect you to have:  Strong mathematical background Decent coding skills and familiarity with Pytorch Basic knowledge of representation learning Basic knowledge of deep-learning explainability methods A strong spirit of independent work and desire to solve interesting research questions  What we offer  An exciting research project with many possibilities to bring in your own ideas.

Contrastive learning is strong because it uses multiple views of an object to learn which information to capture/encode. If the views are smartly chosen through proper augmentations, then information which is useful for the targeted downstream task is learned and the resulting representations are strong.\nContrastive learning has been explored extensively in the natural image domain but there still remain many unanswered questions and untapped potential in the medical domain. The unique nature of medical data offers many avenues to explore to try and determine how best to adapt contrastive learning to medical imaging.\nOne such area is cardiac MR imaging, where instead of having a static image of an object that we wish to encode, we have an entire time series spanning at least one heart beat. The goal of this thesis is to explore how to best select views from a time-series of cardiac MR data to maximize the information learned through contrastive learning.

Thin electrodes placed on the scalp detect tiny electrical charges that result from the activity of brain cells. Given the simple and low-cost setup, in clinical medicine the EEG is used by neurologists to evaluate brain disorders (e.g. epilepsy), to diagnose diseases (e.g. Alzheimer\u0026rsquo;s disease, narcolepsy), or simply to monitor blood flow in the brain. [1]\nWithin the context of this thesis, a dataset containing the EEGs of chronic pain patients (chronic backpain, chronic widespread pain, joint pain, and neuropathic pain) and an age-matching healthy control group is provided by the University Hospital rechts der Isar. Previous work on EEG data of chronic pain patients has shown an increased brain connectivity at specific frequencies in frontal brain areas when compared to the healthy control group.

Self-supervised learning and transfer learning techniques will be leveraged to understand the high-level context of an EEG. The learned EEG representation is then used to predict the brain age.

Privacy in deep learning, however, still comes at a high privacy-utility trade-off that restricts the practical usability of models trained under DP. We, as researchers, try to solve this issue by looking into learning theory and by developing novel approaches that allow DP networks to challenge non-private approaches in clinical application.\nTwo properties that affect all differentially private networks are model size and the chosen privacy parameters during training. In this work, we plan to analyze these two areas and introduce changes to the training regime, that improve not only the performance of the models but also reduce their computational overhead. The goal is to 1) build on top of research done on learning sparse neural networks and correspondingly adapt the model parameters during training [2]. And 2), we look at the amount of total noise added during training with DP and evaluate, how to adapt the corresponding privacy parameters without any knowledge about the model or dataset [3]. If successful, this research can be applied to any differential private model in a plug-and-play fashion during training to further reduce the privacy-utility trade-off. \nYour qualifications: We are looking for a highly motivated Master’s student in Computer Science, Physics, Engineering or Mathematics.

This includes getting familiar with model architectures in general, the properties of equivariant convolutions and the intersection of the two.

These methods are major in the spatial domain which denoise the image straightforwardly by extracting the spatial information using the sliding CNN window. On the other hand, image denoising from the frequency domain also has a long history in which the low-pass filter techniques are applied and the noise (major in high-frequency space) can be filtered out. The denoising optimization in the frequency domain is frequently utilized in medical image reconstruction.

However, this approach is rarely studied in the nature denoising field with RGB images. More recently, the advent of Transformers evolutes the computer vision field. Its inherent attributes like larger receptive field and lower inductive bias facilitate the image denoising tasks.

Therefore, clinical data of patients is usually securely stored on clinic servers without access from outside. Publication of clinical data is difficult and cumbersome as strict privacy and data protection laws must be obeyed. These involve anonymization of patient data, drafting of data sharing agreements, and the approval of the corresponding ethics commission. This complex publication process is one of the key reasons for data shortage in medical domain and is often preventing machine learning approaches to reach their full potential. Federated learning [1] paired with differential privacy [2,3] can circumvent the problem of data publication. Rather than gathering the data from clinical sites to centrally train a machine learning model, the model is distributed to the different sites, locally trained on the (partial) data, and finally, globally aggregated [2]. Thus, patient data is never seen by third parties.\nWe want to construct a proof of concept for a federated learning approach in the domain of fetal MRI segmentation. An existing baseline segmentation model must be modified and embedded in a federated learning environment. The model must then be trained on fetal MRI scans located on several international clinic servers. Furthermore, sufficient privacy standards (e.g. differential privacy [2]) must be discussed and ensured.\nYour qualifications:  advanced knowledge in machine learning and computer vision (experience in federated learning or differential privacy is helpful but not mandatory) good programming skills in Python and a deep learning framework (previous work is based on PyTorch). good communication skills.

Hölzl"],"categories":null,"content":"With estimates of 1 600 000 cases and more than 350 000 deaths annually worldwide, prostate cancer is among the most common cancers in men [1]. Diagnosis of prostate cancer is typically done by using ultrasound-guided needle biopsies. An approach that not only involves risks, due to the invasive nature of the method, but also generally underestimates the aggressiveness of the tumor [2]. Standard positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with prostate cancer specific tracers and specifically PSMA-PET have shown to be advantageous for delineating suspicious lesions during biopsy [3, 4].\nWe want to use the information provided by these PET and multi-parametric MRI images to directly predict Gleason scores that accurately report the aggressiveness of the prostate cancers without the risks associated with an invasive biopsy. Recent research at our institution has produced promising results predicting Gleason scores from handcrafted radiomic features [5]. This work aims at building on top of this research and to develop an end-to-end deep learning pipeline for predicting tumor aggressiveness directly from different imaging modalities. We have exclusive access to a dataset which includes PSMA-11 PET/MRI scans, segmentation maps and the pathological information of the tumors. Additional public data is available through the PI-CAI Challenge. The focus of this work is to build a complete pipeline for analysing multi-modal medical imaging datasets. This includes research on understanding the diverse data available, exploring different approaches for dealing with the limited dataset size (data augmentation, pre-training etc.) and finding a suitable model and evaluation metric for this use case. \nYour qualifications: We are looking for a highly motivated Master’s student in Computer Science, Physics, Engineering or Mathematics. You will establish a comprehensive medical imaging pipeline in PyTorch to extract information from these images. You will be working together with me and under the supervision of Prof. Daniel Rückert.

It has seen initial adoption for the diagnosis and monitoring of clinical conditions that affect the retinal vasculature, such as several different eye diseases or multiple sclerosis [2, 3]. However, its effective clinical use is often impeded by the occurrence of imaging artifacts and lack of tools that can extract the vessel maps from the images. Only few studies have explored the use of deep-learning-based segmentation to delineate vessels in two-dimensional OCTA images [4, 5]. The development of three-dimensional (3D) segmentation algorithms has proven difficult due to a lack of publicly available datasets with ground truth annotations, which are difficult and time-consuming to acquire for the large and complex OCTA images [5].\nThis project aims at tackling the problem of 3D vessel segmentation in OCTA images using unsupervised and weakly supervised deep learning. The prospective student will adopt existing deep-learning-based segmentation algorithms so that these can be trained using self-supervision and noisy annotations. All developed methods will be evaluated on a large dataset of OCTA images collected at the Klinikum rechts der Isar.\n Your qualifications:  Enthusiasm for deep learning and biomedical imaging.

In simple words, Federated Learning enables training models at the client-side while preserving their privacy, and aggregates the knowledge from the nodes to learn a global model. The interesting part here that the data are kept private and not transmitted to any other nodes. Instead, the characteristics (e.g. parameters) of the global model are shared with the clients, and once the training is done locally, the characteristics are sent back to the global one for aggregation. This learning paradigm has been received quite nicely in the community, in particular, for sensitive domains, e.g. Healthcare. To push this momentum, we proposed, together with our academia and industry partners, a workshop on Federated, Collaborative, and Distributed Learning in the International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer-Aided Intervention (MICCAI) to attract significant contributions attacking the challenges in Medical Imaging and Healthcare. In this seminar, we will be discussing the relevant papers on Federated Learning with an emphasis on the papers tackling the common challenges in Medical Imaging, e.g. data heterogeneity, domain shift, and non-iid distributed data.\nDetails For full details on the course please follow this link\n","date":1612569600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1612569600,"objectID":"cef76228a5cc6369217f4d55f8e749f6","permalink":"https://aim-lab.io/theses/federated/","publishdate":"2021-02-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/theses/federated/","section":"theses","summary":"Master Seminar (IN2107, IN4410) (2 SWS, 5 ECTS) offered for BioMedical Computing (BMC) program at the Chair for Computer Aided Medical Procedures and Augmented Reality, TU Munich\nOrganizers: Dr. Shadi Albarqouni, Helmholtz AI and TU Munich, Prof.","tags":null,"title":"Seminar on Federated Learning (SoSe2021)","type":"theses"},{"authors":["s. p. fitzgibbon","s. j. harrison","m. jenkinson","l. baxter","e. c. robinson","m. bastiani","j. bozek","v. karolis","l. cordero grande","a. n. price","e. hughes","a. makropoulos","j. passerat-palmbach","a. schuh","j. gao","s.-r. farahibozorg","j. o'muircheartaigh","j. ciarrusta","c. o'keeffe","j. brandon","t. arichi","d. rueckert","j. v. hajnal","a. d. edwards","s. m. smith","e. duff and j. andersson"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1605990379,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1605990379,"objectID":"74d50ea429a7a0a53b3111368625f625","permalink":"https://aim-lab.io/publication/neuroimage2020a/","publishdate":"2020-11-21T21:26:19+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/neuroimage2020a/","section":"publication","summary":"The developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP) aims to create a detailed 4-dimensional connectome of early life spanning 20–45 weeks post-menstrual age. This is being achieved through the acquisition of multi-modal MRI data from over 1000 in- and ex-utero subjects combined with the development of optimised pre-processing pipelines. In this paper we present an automated and robust pipeline to minimally pre-process highly confounded neonatal resting-state fMRI data, robustly, with low failure rates and high quality-assurance. The pipeline has been designed to specifically address the challenges that neonatal data presents including low and variable contrast and high levels of head motion. We provide a detailed description and evaluation of the pipeline which includes integrated slice-to-volume motion correction and dynamic susceptibility distortion correction, a robust multimodal registration approach, bespoke ICA-based denoising, and an automated QC framework. We assess these components on a large cohort of dHCP subjects and demonstrate that processing refinements integrated into the pipeline provide substantial reduction in movement related distortions, resulting in significant improvements in SNR, and detection of high quality RSNs from neonates.","tags":[],"title":"The developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP) automated resting-state functional processing framework for newborn infants","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Veronika Zimmer"],"categories":null,"content":"Deep learning has revolutionized the field of medical imaging.

This is especially critical in a medical setting, where the amount of labelled training data is often limited, and in particular for the application in clinical routine, where the distribution of the test data cannot be controlled. The automatic detection of such Out-of-Distribution (OoD) samples at inference is important for the design of reliable models, but also to identify poor quality images and pathologies not seen during training.\nRecently, contrastive learning has shown to provide state-of-the-art results for OoD in image classification benchmarks [1]. Contrastive learning is an approach to formulate the task of finding similar and dissimilar samples during training. One advantage of the proposed method is that no OoD data is required during training. The aim of this project is to explore OoD detection in deep learning in general, and in particular the use of contrastive training.

Many of these approaches are based on either mathematical, physical, or biological models. A challenge for these approaches is the modeling of the underlying processes (e.g., the physics of image acquisition or the patho-physiology of a disease) with appropriate levels of detail and realism. With the availability of large amounts of imaging data and machine learning (in particular deep learning) techniques, data-driven approaches have become more widespread for use in different tasks in reconstruction, analysis, and interpretation. These approaches learn statistical models directly from labeled or unlabeled image data and have been shown to be very powerful for extracting clinically useful information from medical imaging. While these data-driven approaches often outperform traditional model-based approaches, their clinical deployment often poses challenges in terms of robustness, generalization ability, and interpretability. In this article, we discuss what developments have motivated the shift from model-based approaches toward data-driven strategies and what potential problems are associated with the move toward purely data-driven approaches, in particular deep learning. We also discuss some of the open challenges for data-driven approaches, e.g., generalization to new unseen data (e.g., transfer learning), robustness to adversarial attacks, and interpretability. Finally, we conclude with a discussion on how these approaches may lead to the development of more closely coupled imaging pipelines that are optimized in an end-to-end fashion.","tags":[],"title":"Model-Based and Data-Driven Strategies in Medical Image Computing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["g. a. kaissis","m. r. makowski","d. rueckert and r. f. braren"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1602478755,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1602478755,"objectID":"64465c564401754b85a2e498011d16a7","permalink":"https://aim-lab.io/www.nature.com/articles/s42256-020-0186-1","publishdate":"2020-10-12T06:59:15+02:00","relpermalink":"/www.nature.com/articles/s42256-020-0186-1","section":"publication","summary":"The broad application of artificial intelligence techniques in medicine is currently hindered by limited dataset availability for algorithm training and validation, due to the absence of standardized electronic medical records, and strict legal and ethical requirements to protect patient privacy.

The function of these trabeculae in adults and their genetic architecture are unknown. Here we performed a genome-wide association study to investigate image-derived phenotypes of trabeculae using the fractal analysis of trabecular morphology in 18,096 participants of the UK Biobank. We identified 16 significant loci that contain genes associated with haemodynamic phenotypes and regulation of cytoskeletal arborization3,4. Using biomechanical simulations and observational data from human participants, we demonstrate that trabecular morphology is an important determinant of cardiac performance. Through genetic association studies with cardiac disease phenotypes and Mendelian randomization, we find a causal relationship between trabecular morphology and risk of cardiovascular disease. These findings suggest a previously unknown role for myocardial trabeculae in the function of the adult heart, identify conserved pathways that regulate structural complexity and reveal the influence of the myocardial trabeculae on susceptibility to cardiovascular disease.","tags":[],"title":"Genetic and functional insights into the fractal structure of the heart","type":"publication"}]
