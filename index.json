Gone are the days when we passively absorbed health information. Today, we\u0026rsquo;re in the age of data-driven insights, where personalized health data is not just recorded but actively analyzed to provide actionable insights. ​ In MeDecode we want to embody this evolution, we are a pre-registered startup founded six months ago by an active team of three co-founders, and we are currently seeking a student to contribute to the software development efforts to create a Minimal Viable Product. Offering users an intuitive platform to monitor, compare and understand various health metrics, this project truly stands apart with its emphasis on comparative insights against other users. In the vast sea of health data, understanding one\u0026rsquo;s metrics in isolation offers limited insight. Is a heart rate of 80 bpm at rest good or bad? How does a person\u0026rsquo;s sleep pattern compare with someone of their age and lifestyle? By allowing users to compare their data against that of others, we offer a clearer, contextualized view of their health. This not only bridges the gap between mere data collection and genuine understanding but also creates a more engaging and motivating user experience. ​ However, with the power of comparative insights comes a significant responsibility: ensuring user privacy and data anonymization. Firstly, it serves to protect user identity, ensuring that while data can be compared, individual identities remain concealed. Secondly, when users are aware that their data is anonymized, they are more inclined to report honestly, leading to more accurate and reliable comparative insights.

Specifically, we want to solve the transfer learning problem for the computer vision task of graph extraction from images (e.g. road network extraction, blood-vessel network extraction, scene graph generation, or pose estimation) [2].\nTo address these challenges, we propose two innovative strategies where one or ideally both can be explored during the course of the thesis:\n  Contrastive Learning for Domain Alignment [1]: Leveraging the power of contrastive learning, we seek to achieve domain alignment while harnessing label information from both domains.\n  Image-to-Image Translation with Generative Models: By exploring the capabilities of diffusion models [3] or GANs [4], we aim to generate target domain samples from source domain data.\n  Both of these approaches will be applied to the Relationformer architecture, a unified one-stage transformer-based framework introduced in our recent ECCV paper [2].

Hölzl"],"categories":null,"content":"Anonymizing data means removing or replacing any identifying information from a dataset, such as names or addresses. The aim of anonymization is to protect the privacy of individuals whose data is being collected and processed. However, anonymizing data is not sufficient to guarantee privacy protection. Research has shown that data samples can easily re-identified through a variety of approaches as simply as combining a dataset with other data sources, e.g. publicly available information [1]. This poses a problem for data sharing, especially in highly sensitive domains such as medicine.\nSynthetic data allows to generate new examples that preserve the statistical properties of the original data [2]. In a medical use case, synthetic data could be used to generate realistic but entirely artificial medical records. These synthetic medical records can be used for a variety of different purposes, such as augmenting existing datasets or sharing data without revealing any patient information [3].\nFor the later, however, synthetic data doesn\u0026rsquo;t per se protect the privacy of individual patients. To achieve privacy preservation, we have to apply additional techniques such as differential privacy [4]. The aim of this project is to evaluate synthetic data generation with differential privacy for tabular medical records. You will first evaluate current literature of synthetic data generation for tabular data with regards to medical records [5, 6]. In the following, a data generation pipeline will be implemented and analysed to evaluate the performance of existing synthetisation approaches on a real-world multiple sclerosis dataset. The data will be used to predict disease activity and help treatment decision making for disease-modifying therapies [7]. To measure the prediction capabilities of the synthetically generated private data, its prediction performance is compared against existing baselines from the original data curated during different time intervals. Furthermore, the addition of synthetic data into the existing training process for increased model robustness will be assessed. This project will help to evaluate the ability of synthetic data to enable data sharing in a privacy preserving manner and additionally its potential benefits for increasing model robustness due to data augmentation. \nYour qualifications We are looking for a highly motivated Master\u0026rsquo;s student in Computer Science, Physics, Engineering or Mathematics.

This is being achieved through the acquisition of multi-modal MRI data from over 1000 in- and ex-utero subjects combined with the development of optimised pre-processing pipelines. In this paper we present an automated and robust pipeline to minimally pre-process highly confounded neonatal resting-state fMRI data, robustly, with low failure rates and high quality-assurance. The pipeline has been designed to specifically address the challenges that neonatal data presents including low and variable contrast and high levels of head motion. We provide a detailed description and evaluation of the pipeline which includes integrated slice-to-volume motion correction and dynamic susceptibility distortion correction, a robust multimodal registration approach, bespoke ICA-based denoising, and an automated QC framework. We assess these components on a large cohort of dHCP subjects and demonstrate that processing refinements integrated into the pipeline provide substantial reduction in movement related distortions, resulting in significant improvements in SNR, and detection of high quality RSNs from neonates.","tags":[],"title":"The developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP) automated resting-state functional processing framework for newborn infants","type":"publication"},{"authors":["D.

Many of these approaches are based on either mathematical, physical, or biological models. A challenge for these approaches is the modeling of the underlying processes (e.g., the physics of image acquisition or the patho-physiology of a disease) with appropriate levels of detail and realism. With the availability of large amounts of imaging data and machine learning (in particular deep learning) techniques, data-driven approaches have become more widespread for use in different tasks in reconstruction, analysis, and interpretation. These approaches learn statistical models directly from labeled or unlabeled image data and have been shown to be very powerful for extracting clinically useful information from medical imaging. While these data-driven approaches often outperform traditional model-based approaches, their clinical deployment often poses challenges in terms of robustness, generalization ability, and interpretability. In this article, we discuss what developments have motivated the shift from model-based approaches toward data-driven strategies and what potential problems are associated with the move toward purely data-driven approaches, in particular deep learning. We also discuss some of the open challenges for data-driven approaches, e.g., generalization to new unseen data (e.g., transfer learning), robustness to adversarial attacks, and interpretability. Finally, we conclude with a discussion on how these approaches may lead to the development of more closely coupled imaging pipelines that are optimized in an end-to-end fashion.","tags":[],"title":"Model-Based and Data-Driven Strategies in Medical Image Computing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["G.

The function of these trabeculae in adults and their genetic architecture are unknown. Here we performed a genome-wide association study to investigate image-derived phenotypes of trabeculae using the fractal analysis of trabecular morphology in 18,096 participants of the UK Biobank. We identified 16 significant loci that contain genes associated with haemodynamic phenotypes and regulation of cytoskeletal arborization3,4. Using biomechanical simulations and observational data from human participants, we demonstrate that trabecular morphology is an important determinant of cardiac performance. Through genetic association studies with cardiac disease phenotypes and Mendelian randomization, we find a causal relationship between trabecular morphology and risk of cardiovascular disease. These findings suggest a previously unknown role for myocardial trabeculae in the function of the adult heart, identify conserved pathways that regulate structural complexity and reveal the influence of the myocardial trabeculae on susceptibility to cardiovascular disease.","tags":[],"title":"Genetic and functional insights into the fractal structure of the heart","type":"publication"}]
