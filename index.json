It holds images (brain MRI, abdominal MRI) as well as several thousand clinical parameters of the participants (demographic data, lifestyle data, clinical diagnoses,…). The lack of available data is a big challenge in medical applications of artificial intelligence. Therefore, the UK Biobank holds great potential to explore ML techniques on a large standardised dataset.  Methods: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are currently a hot topic in research. They provide a method for deep learning, directly applied on graph structured data. The goal of this project is to build a population graph, which holds extracted information from both, imaging data and clinical features, to predict the participants’ age. The advantage of building a population graph is that it allows to explore the whole dataset in one data structure. By comparing the actual biological age versus the predicted age from the network, we can draw conclusions about the participants’ health. The high dimensionality and the size of this dataset provide perfect conditions for data exploration and gives the freedom to implement own ideas and personal interests.\n Your qualifications:  Prior knowledge in deep learning and computer vision Very good programming skills in PyTorch Interest in graph neural networks and geometric deep learning  If you are interested, please send us an email with your CV attached.

It has seen initial adoption for the diagnosis and monitoring of clinical conditions that affect the retinal vasculature, such as several different eye diseases or multiple sclerosis [2, 3]. However, its effective clinical use is often impeded by the occurrence of imaging artifacts and lack of tools that can extract the vessel maps from the images. Only few studies have explored the use of deep-learning-based segmentation to delineate vessels in two-dimensional OCTA images [4, 5]. The development of three-dimensional (3D) segmentation algorithms has proven difficult due to a lack of publicly available datasets with ground truth annotations, which are difficult and time-consuming to acquire for the large and complex OCTA images [5].\nThis project aims at tackling the problem of 3D vessel segmentation in OCTA images using unsupervised and weakly supervised deep learning. The prospective student will adopt existing deep-learning-based segmentation algorithms so that these can be trained using self-supervision and noisy annotations. All developed methods will be evaluated on a large dataset of OCTA images collected at the Klinikum rechts der Isar.\n Your qualifications:  Enthusiasm for deep learning and biomedical imaging.

The sooner a potential malignant growth is detected, the more effective the next steps in therapy and the better a prognosis usually becomes. The rarity of musculoskeletal tumours, potentially inexperienced clinicians with this certain entity, as well as unspecific anamnesis and clinical manifestations may delay the final diagnosis. Whereas currently available imaging modalities yield considerable insights into tumour staging and grading, biopsy remains the gold standard for final diagnosis. Yet, the planning of a successful biopsy yielding sufficient material might require time aside from a high level of experience and may delay the final diagnosis even further.\nThe complexity in conjunction with multimodal approaches in fully grasping this disease provide a very suitable foundation for modern artificial intelligence algorithms. Not only for diagnostic purposes, but also for treatment planning or prognosis prediction, machine learning and deep learning algorithms are popular techniques in many disciplines at this time.\nTasks Various topics in the domain of musculoskeletal tumor analysis are available for a master thesis in computer science and can be discussed during an interview.\nThe main tasks will involve:\n Analysis of sarcoma with machine/deep learning Coping with very limited and unbalanced datasets Adaption to medicine specific issues with AI Presenting and discussing results  What we offer  Access to very rare medical data Highly educated \u0026amp; interdisciplinary environment Top level hardware for scientific computing Constant feedback from medical and computer science experts  Prerequisites  Advanced knowledge of deep learning with imaging data Beneficial but not necessary: experience in medicine / oncology  References [1] Rechl H, Kirchhoff C, Wörtler K, Lenze U, Töpfer A, von Eisenhart-Rothe R.

Thus, our goal is to pre-train a NLP model for the domain of German radiology reports such that the resulting model can be easily fine-tuned for prediction tasks.\nWe offer flexibility regarding the objectives of this MSc thesis. Possible tasks may include but are not limited to:\n Domain adaptation of pre-trained models Adaption or development of a pre-training strategy for radiology reports Development of a model architecture for radiology reports Development of a data augmentation strategy Utilization of additional data sources for pre-training (e.g. Wikipedia or books)  We can define the topic of your thesis, such that it matches your interests as good as possible.\nRequirements  Strong background in deep learning Proficient in Python Experience with ML frameworks, preferable PyTorch  Prior experience or knowledge (e.g. lectures) in NLP is beneficial but not required.\nReferences  J.

In simple words, Federated Learning enables training models at the client-side while preserving their privacy, and aggregates the knowledge from the nodes to learn a global model. The interesting part here that the data are kept private and not transmitted to any other nodes. Instead, the characteristics (e.g. parameters) of the global model are shared with the clients, and once the training is done locally, the characteristics are sent back to the global one for aggregation. This learning paradigm has been received quite nicely in the community, in particular, for sensitive domains, e.g. Healthcare. To push this momentum, we proposed, together with our academia and industry partners, a workshop on Federated, Collaborative, and Distributed Learning in the International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer-Aided Intervention (MICCAI) to attract significant contributions attacking the challenges in Medical Imaging and Healthcare. In this seminar, we will be discussing the relevant papers on Federated Learning with an emphasis on the papers tackling the common challenges in Medical Imaging, e.g. data heterogeneity, domain shift, and non-iid distributed data.\nDetails For full details on the course please follow this link\n","date":1612569600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1612569600,"objectID":"cef76228a5cc6369217f4d55f8e749f6","permalink":"https://aim-lab.io/theses/federated/","publishdate":"2021-02-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/theses/federated/","section":"theses","summary":"Master Seminar (IN2107, IN4410) (2 SWS, 5 ECTS) offered for BioMedical Computing (BMC) program at the Chair for Computer Aided Medical Procedures and Augmented Reality, TU Munich\nOrganizers: Dr. Shadi Albarqouni, Helmholtz AI and TU Munich, Prof.","tags":null,"title":"Seminar on Federated Learning (SoSe2021)","type":"theses"},{"authors":["s. p. fitzgibbon","s. j. harrison","m. jenkinson","l. baxter","e. c. robinson","m. bastiani","j. bozek","v. karolis","l. cordero grande","a. n. price","e. hughes","a. makropoulos","j. passerat-palmbach","a. schuh","j. gao","s.-r. farahibozorg","j. o'muircheartaigh","j. ciarrusta","c. o'keeffe","j. brandon","t. arichi","d. rueckert","j. v. hajnal","a. d. edwards","s. m. smith","e. duff and j. andersson"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1605990379,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1605990379,"objectID":"74d50ea429a7a0a53b3111368625f625","permalink":"https://aim-lab.io/publication/neuroimage2020a/","publishdate":"2020-11-21T21:26:19+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/neuroimage2020a/","section":"publication","summary":"The developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP) aims to create a detailed 4-dimensional connectome of early life spanning 20–45 weeks post-menstrual age. This is being achieved through the acquisition of multi-modal MRI data from over 1000 in- and ex-utero subjects combined with the development of optimised pre-processing pipelines. In this paper we present an automated and robust pipeline to minimally pre-process highly confounded neonatal resting-state fMRI data, robustly, with low failure rates and high quality-assurance. The pipeline has been designed to specifically address the challenges that neonatal data presents including low and variable contrast and high levels of head motion. We provide a detailed description and evaluation of the pipeline which includes integrated slice-to-volume motion correction and dynamic susceptibility distortion correction, a robust multimodal registration approach, bespoke ICA-based denoising, and an automated QC framework. We assess these components on a large cohort of dHCP subjects and demonstrate that processing refinements integrated into the pipeline provide substantial reduction in movement related distortions, resulting in significant improvements in SNR, and detection of high quality RSNs from neonates.","tags":[],"title":"The developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP) automated resting-state functional processing framework for newborn infants","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kerstin Hammernik"],"categories":null,"content":"Fetal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has become increasingly important to assess the development of the fetal brain.

The automatic detection of such Out-of-Distribution (OoD) samples at inference is important for the design of reliable models, but also to identify poor quality images and pathologies not seen during training.\nRecently, contrastive learning has shown to provide state-of-the-art results for OoD in image classification benchmarks [1]. Contrastive learning is an approach to formulate the task of finding similar and dissimilar samples during training. One advantage of the proposed method is that no OoD data is required during training. The aim of this project is to explore OoD detection in deep learning in general, and in particular the use of contrastive training.

Many of these approaches are based on either mathematical, physical, or biological models. A challenge for these approaches is the modeling of the underlying processes (e.g., the physics of image acquisition or the patho-physiology of a disease) with appropriate levels of detail and realism. With the availability of large amounts of imaging data and machine learning (in particular deep learning) techniques, data-driven approaches have become more widespread for use in different tasks in reconstruction, analysis, and interpretation. These approaches learn statistical models directly from labeled or unlabeled image data and have been shown to be very powerful for extracting clinically useful information from medical imaging. While these data-driven approaches often outperform traditional model-based approaches, their clinical deployment often poses challenges in terms of robustness, generalization ability, and interpretability. In this article, we discuss what developments have motivated the shift from model-based approaches toward data-driven strategies and what potential problems are associated with the move toward purely data-driven approaches, in particular deep learning. We also discuss some of the open challenges for data-driven approaches, e.g., generalization to new unseen data (e.g., transfer learning), robustness to adversarial attacks, and interpretability. Finally, we conclude with a discussion on how these approaches may lead to the development of more closely coupled imaging pipelines that are optimized in an end-to-end fashion.","tags":[],"title":"Model-Based and Data-Driven Strategies in Medical Image Computing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["g. a. kaissis","m. r. makowski","d. rueckert and r. f. braren"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1602478755,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1602478755,"objectID":"64465c564401754b85a2e498011d16a7","permalink":"https://aim-lab.io/www.nature.com/articles/s42256-020-0186-1","publishdate":"2020-10-12T06:59:15+02:00","relpermalink":"/www.nature.com/articles/s42256-020-0186-1","section":"publication","summary":"The broad application of artificial intelligence techniques in medicine is currently hindered by limited dataset availability for algorithm training and validation, due to the absence of standardized electronic medical records, and strict legal and ethical requirements to protect patient privacy.
