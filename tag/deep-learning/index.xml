      <title>MSc Thesis: End-to-end survival prediction on CT images of PDAC patients</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is considered the fourteenth most common cancer globally, the seventh on the list of causes of cancer death in 2020, and the fourth in 2021. To further investigate the causes and therapy for affected patients we aim to extend our previous work. This project is perfect for students who like to work on applied deep learning. Tasks vary from simple hyperparameter optimisation to dedicated auxillary networks and multi-task learning. If you are interested kindly send us a message including your CV, transcript of records, and very briefly what you are looking for, expecting in your thesis, your talents and interests in regard to this thesis are and if applicable a short description of a project that you did. We are looking forward to your message.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Deep Learning in the context of medical imaging (MSc Thesis/Guided Research/IDP/etc)</title>
      <link>https://aim-lab.io/theses/privacy/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning is a very recent topic of ongoing research. Especially in the medical field large amounts of data are locked due to privacy regulations. PPML allows the training on data of patients while asserting they face no repercussions by participating. Lots of applications need to be researched in depth. Exact project definitions would be specified depending on your interests and talents, but range from rather theoretical work to heavily applied projects. If you are interested kindly send us a message including your CV, transcript of records, and very briefly what you are looking for, expecting in your thesis, your talents and interests are and if applicable a short description of a project that you did. We are looking forward to your message.&lt;/p&gt;
