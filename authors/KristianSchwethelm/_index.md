I’m a PhD student affiliated with the Institute of Artificial Intelligence in Medicine at the Technical University of Munich (TUM). Before starting my PhD, I received an MSc. from the University of Hildesheim and a BSc. from Ostfalia University in cooperation with Robert Bosch GmbH. Throughout my academic journey, I specialized in machine learning, focusing on computer vision and geometric deep learning. Currently, my research centers on privacy-preserving machine learning, with an emphasis on differential privacy and its applications in medical imaging.
