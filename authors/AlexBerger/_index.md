Alexander Berger is a PhD student at the Chair for Artificial Intelligence in Medicine at the Technical University of Munich (TUM). His main research focus is the development of deep learning methods for extracting and analysing graph-structured information from medical images. Most of his applications aim at improving diagnosis and treatment of diseases. Furthermore, Alexander is interested in self- and weakly-supervised transfer learning and domain adaptation. He received his M.Sc. at TUM under Prof. Daniel RÃ¼ckert.

Topics for BSc and MSc Thesis, Semester Projects, IDPs, Guided Research or any other student project can always be discussed on inquiry.
