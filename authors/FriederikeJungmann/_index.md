Friederike Jungmann is a researcher at the Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Informatics in Medicine and an assistant radiologist at the Institute for Radiology at TUM. She received her medical degree in 2021 at TUM. In the course of her doctoral degree, Friederike completed multiple projects on developing machine learning applications for analyzing computed tomography images. Furthermore, she has worked on projects developing privacy-preserving machine learning methods. Currently, Friederike is researching in the topic of human-in-the-loop machine learning, focusing on the interpretability of models and the interaction between humans and algorithms with the goal of integrating secure, transparent and robust machine learning algorithms into clinical workflows.
