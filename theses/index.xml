      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The detection and segmentation of bone tumors using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have crucial implications for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning. With the advent of deep learning techniques, there&amp;rsquo;s a growing interest in leveraging these methods to analyze MRI bone tumor images. However, a fundamental question arises: Is 3D volumetric processing superior to traditional 2D slice-by-slice processing in deep learning tasks for MRI bone tumor analysis? This research addresses this question by evaluating the effectiveness of 2D versus 3D deep learning methodologies.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;methodology&#34;&gt;Methodology:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The methodology involves implementing several deep-learning models to compare the efficacy of 2D and 3D techniques for MRI bone tumor analysis:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>IDP/Thesis: Physics-based deep learning for hyperspectral brain surgery imaging</title>
      <link>https://aim-lab.io/theses/ivanezhov/</link>

      <guid>https://aim-lab.io/theses/ivanezhov/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is an optical technique that processes the electromagnetic spectrum at a multitude of monochromatic, adjacent frequency bands. The wide-bandwidth spectral signature of a target object&amp;rsquo;s reflectance allows fingerprinting its physical, biochemical, and physiological properties. HSI has been applied for various applications, such as remote sensing and biological tissue analysis. Recently, HSI was also used to differentiate between healthy and pathological tissue under operative conditions in a surgery room on patients diagnosed with brain tumors [1].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within the &lt;a href=&#34;https://hyperprobe.eu&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;HyperProbe&lt;/a&gt; project, we aim to develop a novel all-optical, AI-powered intraoperative imaging system to transform monitoring of brain tumour surgery.
Your goal would be to develop a methodology at the intersection between physics and machine-learning to identify biomarkers of healthy and tumor brain tissue.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>IDP: iOS app for wearable health data management</title>
      <link>https://aim-lab.io/theses/florianhinterwimmer/idp_wearables/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 16 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://aim-lab.io/theses/florianhinterwimmer/idp_wearables/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;​&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;description&#34;&gt;Description&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an era where technology has seamlessly integrated with our day-to-day lives, health and fitness tracking has seen a revolutionary change. Gone are the days when we passively absorbed health information. Today, we&amp;rsquo;re in the age of data-driven insights, where personalized health data is not just recorded but actively analyzed to provide actionable insights.
​
In MeDecode we want to embody this evolution, we are a pre-registered startup founded six months ago by an active team of three co-founders, and we are currently seeking a student to contribute to the software development efforts to create a Minimal Viable Product. Offering users an intuitive platform to monitor, compare and understand various health metrics, this project truly stands apart with its emphasis on comparative insights against other users. In the vast sea of health data, understanding one&amp;rsquo;s metrics in isolation offers limited insight. Is a heart rate of 80 bpm at rest good or bad? How does a person&amp;rsquo;s sleep pattern compare with someone of their age and lifestyle? By allowing users to compare their data against that of others, we offer a clearer, contextualized view of their health. This not only bridges the gap between mere data collection and genuine understanding but also creates a more engaging and motivating user experience.
​
However, with the power of comparative insights comes a significant responsibility: ensuring user privacy and data anonymization. Firstly, it serves to protect user identity, ensuring that while data can be compared, individual identities remain concealed. Secondly, when users are aware that their data is anonymized, they are more inclined to report honestly, leading to more accurate and reliable comparative insights. Lastly, in the unfortunate event of a data breach, the anonymization of data drastically reduces its value to malicious actors, as it can&amp;rsquo;t be linked back to specific individuals, thereby minimizing potential harm.
&lt;br/&gt;
​&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;your-qualifications&#34;&gt;Your qualifications&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​
We are actively seeking an enthusiastic Master&amp;rsquo;s student, preferably majoring in Computer Science, Information Systems, or Health Informatics. Your core responsibility will be to develop a simple iOS app that reads, saves and plots the HealthKit data. Your base of operations will be at the Institute for AI in Medicine, working closely with Doctors and Wearables Artificial Intelligence experts. It is our collective ambition to bring this project to the market, and we envision you playing a pivotal role.
​&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong motivation and interest in wearable technology, healthcare and/or artificial intelligence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advanced programming skills in Swift (or preferred iOS programming language).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Independent working style with strong interest in teamwork.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An exciting  project in scope of a highly dynamic startup environment with many possibilities to bring in your own ideas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Close supervision and access to the necessary hardware.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The chance to work in a team of highly qualified computer scientists and medical experts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;experiencing the development of an early stage tech/health startup&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;potential for long-term engagment

      <title>MSc Thesis: Contrastive Learning and Generative Models for Cross-Domain Transfer Learning</title>
      <link>https://aim-lab.io/theses/johannespaetzold/diffusionformer/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 10 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://aim-lab.io/theses/johannespaetzold/diffusionformer/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this Master thesis we aim to approach the cross-domain transfer learning problem with two powerful methods that help us to bridge the domain gap between source and target domain: contrastive learning [1] and generative models. Specifically, we want to solve the transfer learning problem for the computer vision task of graph extraction from images (e.g. road network extraction, blood-vessel network extraction, scene graph generation, or pose estimation) [2].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address these challenges, we propose two innovative strategies where one or ideally both can be explored during the course of the thesis:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrastive Learning for Domain Alignment [1]: Leveraging the power of contrastive learning, we seek to achieve domain alignment while harnessing label information from both domains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Image-to-Image Translation with Generative Models: By exploring the capabilities of diffusion models [3] or GANs [4], we aim to generate target domain samples from source domain data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of these approaches will be applied to the Relationformer architecture, a unified one-stage transformer-based framework introduced in our recent ECCV paper [2]. Our experimentation will involve working with extensive biological datasets, such as whole brain vasculature [5], neurons, and satellite imagery.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;./tl_datasets.png&#34; alt=&#34;image datasets&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;your-qualifications&#34;&gt;Your qualifications:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are looking for a highly motivated Master’s student in Computer Science, Physics, Engineering or Mathematics. Your goal is to extend the existing Pytorch codebase and apply it to novel datasets. You will be working together with Johannes and Alex, two PostDocs scientist at TU Munich and Imperial College London under the supervision of Prof. Daniel Rückert. Importantly, we aim to publish the results of this work, with you, in a follow up study at a high-impact machine learning conference or in an academic journal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong motivation and interest in machine learning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advanced programming skills in C++, Python or C.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong interest in teamwork and interdisciplinary research.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-we-offer&#34;&gt;What we offer:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An exciting research project with many possibilities to bring in your own ideas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Close supervision and access to state-of-the-art computer hardware.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The chance to work in a team of highly qualified experts in machine learning, computer vision, and deep learning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Anonymizing data means removing or replacing any identifying information from a dataset, such as names or addresses. The aim of anonymization is to protect the privacy of individuals whose data is being collected and processed. However, anonymizing data is not sufficient to guarantee privacy protection. Research has shown that data samples can easily re-identified through a variety of approaches as simply as combining a dataset with other data sources, e.g. publicly available information [1]. This poses a problem for data sharing, especially in highly sensitive domains such as medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Synthetic data allows to generate new examples that preserve the statistical properties of the original data [2]. In a medical use case, synthetic data could be used to generate realistic but entirely artificial medical records. These synthetic medical records can be used for a variety of different purposes, such as augmenting existing datasets or sharing data without revealing any patient information [3].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the later, however, synthetic data doesn&amp;rsquo;t per se protect the privacy of individual patients. To achieve privacy preservation, we have to apply additional techniques such as differential privacy [4]. The aim of this project is to evaluate synthetic data generation with differential privacy for tabular medical records. You will first evaluate current literature of synthetic data generation for tabular data with regards to medical records [5, 6]. In the following, a data generation pipeline will be implemented and analysed to evaluate the performance of existing synthetisation approaches on a real-world multiple sclerosis dataset. The data will be used to predict disease activity and help treatment decision making for disease-modifying therapies [7]. To measure the prediction capabilities of the synthetically generated private data, its prediction performance is compared against existing baselines from the original data curated during different time intervals. Furthermore, the addition of synthetic data into the existing training process for increased model robustness will be assessed. This project will help to evaluate the ability of synthetic data to enable data sharing in a privacy preserving manner and additionally its potential benefits for increasing model robustness due to data augmentation.
