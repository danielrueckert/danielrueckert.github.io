      <description>&lt;p&gt;This project is hosted at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dqbm.uzh.ch/en/research/menze.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Biomedical Image Analysis and Machine Learning Lab&lt;/a&gt; of the University of Zurich.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brain is one of the most complex organs in the human body. Its proper functioning relies heavily on a vast network of blood vessels
known as the brain vasculature. The brain vasculature is not only responsible for delivering oxygen and nutrients to the brain&amp;rsquo;s neurons
and removing waste products but also plays a critical role in regulating cerebral blood flow and maintaining the blood-brain barrier.
Therefore, obtaining a deeper understanding of the brain vasculature&amp;rsquo;s structure and function is essential to study human intelligence
and to gain insights into various neurological disorders, such as stroke, dementia, and brain tumors. Recent advances in imaging
technologies [1, 3, 4, 5] have enabled researchers to study the whole brain vasculature in unprecedented detail. In this context, a
promising approach is represented by transforming brain vasculature into graph-structured data [2] consisting of blood vessels (edges)
and their bifurcation points (vertices).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;aim&#34;&gt;Aim:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aim of this project is to use and develop novel (potentially ML-based) algorithms to obtain a deeper understanding of the graph-structured vasculature preserved in corrosion casts [1].
To this end, potential projects include whole-brain quantitative analysis, graph neural networks, label propagation, and/or novel graph-based clustering approaches [2, 3].
A nice starting point would be to explore weakly supervised label propagation approaches (see following &lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03594&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;ICLR paper&lt;/a&gt;).
The aim should also be to contribute to a scientific publication.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MSc Thesis: Semi-offline Reinforcement Learning for Active Feature Acquisition</title>
      <link>https://aim-lab.io/theses/henrikvonkleist/master_thesis_afa/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 10 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://aim-lab.io/theses/henrikvonkleist/master_thesis_afa/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this Master thesis, we aim to develop novel &lt;em&gt;semi-offline reinforcement learning (RL)&lt;/em&gt; methods for the task of &lt;em&gt;active feature acquisition (AFA)&lt;/em&gt; and apply these methods to the medical problem of &lt;em&gt;sepsis diagnosis&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6 id=&#34;what-is-active-feature-acquisition-afa&#34;&gt;What is active feature acquisition (AFA)?&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Classification methods often assume input features are available at no cost. However, in domains like healthcare, where acquiring features could be expensive or harmful, it is necessary to balance a feature’s acquisition cost against its predictive value. AFA addresses this problem by training two AI systems: i) the &amp;ldquo;AFA agent&amp;rdquo;, a reinforcement learning agent tasked with determining which features should be acquired, and ii) a classification model that performs a diagnosis based on the acquired feature set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6 id=&#34;what-is-semi-offline-reinforcement-learning-rl&#34;&gt;What is semi-offline reinforcement learning (RL)?&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We only have access to historical datasets where a doctor decided on the feature acquisitions. We would like to, however, answer questions about what would have happened if the AFA agent had decided on the feature acquisitions. This requires counterfactual reasoning and thus methods from causal inference/dynamic treatment regimes/offline RL. In recent work [1,2], we showed that one can achieve significant data efficiency benefits in AFA settings compared to regular offline RL settings by simulating additional data points within a novel semi-offline RL framework.  We now want to extend this semi-offline RL framework which is currently only used for agent evaluation to also handle optimization of agents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6 id=&#34;how-can-this-be-used-for-sepsis-prediction&#34;&gt;How can this be used for sepsis prediction?&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sepsis is caused by an infection and can cause up to 35% of in-hospital deaths [3]. Early detection is thus crucial and can increase the chance of survival significantly. Prediction models for the task of sepsis prediction have already been successfully included in hospital settings and have shown to reduce the mortality due to sepsis [4]. We aim to augment this prediction process, by additionally recommending how to schedule blood tests, needed for accurate sepsis prediction using AFA. Additionally, we plan to extend this research to applications in hematology and Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;your-qualifications&#34;&gt;Your qualifications:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are looking for a highly motivated Master’s student in Bioinformatics, Computer Science, Physics, Engineering or Mathematics. Your task is to extend the existing AFA codebase to include the optimization of RL agent and to apply it to novel datasets. You will be working together with Henrik, a PhD student supervised by Prof. Daniel Rückert at TUM and Carsten Marr at Helmholtz Munich. Importantly, we aim to publish the results of this work, with you, at a high-impact machine learning conference or in an academic journal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strong interest in teamwork and interdisciplinary research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

      <title>IDP: iOS app for wearable health data management</title>
      <link>https://aim-lab.io/theses/florianhinterwimmer/idp_wearables/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 16 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://aim-lab.io/theses/florianhinterwimmer/idp_wearables/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;​&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;description&#34;&gt;Description&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an era where technology has seamlessly integrated with our day-to-day lives, health and fitness tracking has seen a revolutionary change. Gone are the days when we passively absorbed health information. Today, we&amp;rsquo;re in the age of data-driven insights, where personalized health data is not just recorded but actively analyzed to provide actionable insights.
​
In MeDecode we want to embody this evolution, we are a pre-registered startup founded six months ago by an active team of three co-founders, and we are currently seeking a student to contribute to the software development efforts to create a Minimal Viable Product. Offering users an intuitive platform to monitor, compare and understand various health metrics, this project truly stands apart with its emphasis on comparative insights against other users. In the vast sea of health data, understanding one&amp;rsquo;s metrics in isolation offers limited insight. Is a heart rate of 80 bpm at rest good or bad? How does a person&amp;rsquo;s sleep pattern compare with someone of their age and lifestyle? By allowing users to compare their data against that of others, we offer a clearer, contextualized view of their health. This not only bridges the gap between mere data collection and genuine understanding but also creates a more engaging and motivating user experience.
​
However, with the power of comparative insights comes a significant responsibility: ensuring user privacy and data anonymization. Firstly, it serves to protect user identity, ensuring that while data can be compared, individual identities remain concealed. Secondly, when users are aware that their data is anonymized, they are more inclined to report honestly, leading to more accurate and reliable comparative insights. Lastly, in the unfortunate event of a data breach, the anonymization of data drastically reduces its value to malicious actors, as it can&amp;rsquo;t be linked back to specific individuals, thereby minimizing potential harm.
&lt;br/&gt;
​&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;your-qualifications&#34;&gt;Your qualifications&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​
We are actively seeking an enthusiastic Master&amp;rsquo;s student, preferably majoring in Computer Science, Information Systems, or Health Informatics. Your core responsibility will be to develop a simple iOS app that reads, saves and plots the HealthKit data. Your base of operations will be at the Institute for AI in Medicine, working closely with Doctors and Wearables Artificial Intelligence experts. It is our collective ambition to bring this project to the market, and we envision you playing a pivotal role.
​&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong motivation and interest in wearable technology, healthcare and/or artificial intelligence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advanced programming skills in Swift (or preferred iOS programming language).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Independent working style with strong interest in teamwork.

      <title>MSc Thesis: Contrastive Learning and Generative Models for Cross-Domain Transfer Learning</title>
      <link>https://aim-lab.io/theses/johannespaetzold/diffusionformer/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 10 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://aim-lab.io/theses/johannespaetzold/diffusionformer/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this Master thesis we aim to approach the cross-domain transfer learning problem with two powerful methods that help us to bridge the domain gap between source and target domain: contrastive learning [1] and generative models. Specifically, we want to solve the transfer learning problem for the computer vision task of graph extraction from images (e.g. road network extraction, blood-vessel network extraction, scene graph generation, or pose estimation) [2].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address these challenges, we propose two innovative strategies where one or ideally both can be explored during the course of the thesis:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrastive Learning for Domain Alignment [1]: Leveraging the power of contrastive learning, we seek to achieve domain alignment while harnessing label information from both domains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Image-to-Image Translation with Generative Models: By exploring the capabilities of diffusion models [3] or GANs [4], we aim to generate target domain samples from source domain data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of these approaches will be applied to the Relationformer architecture, a unified one-stage transformer-based framework introduced in our recent ECCV paper [2]. Our experimentation will involve working with extensive biological datasets, such as whole brain vasculature [5], neurons, and satellite imagery.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;./tl_datasets.png&#34; alt=&#34;image datasets&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;your-qualifications&#34;&gt;Your qualifications:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are looking for a highly motivated Master’s student in Computer Science, Physics, Engineering or Mathematics. Your goal is to extend the existing Pytorch codebase and apply it to novel datasets. You will be working together with Johannes and Alex, two PostDocs scientist at TU Munich and Imperial College London under the supervision of Prof. Daniel Rückert. Importantly, we aim to publish the results of this work, with you, in a follow up study at a high-impact machine learning conference or in an academic journal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong motivation and interest in machine learning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advanced programming skills in C++, Python or C.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong interest in teamwork and interdisciplinary research.&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>MSc Thesis/Guided Research/IDP: Privacy-Preserving Synthetic Data Generation of Medical Tabular Records</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Anonymizing data means removing or replacing any identifying information from a dataset, such as names or addresses. The aim of anonymization is to protect the privacy of individuals whose data is being collected and processed. However, anonymizing data is not sufficient to guarantee privacy protection. Research has shown that data samples can easily re-identified through a variety of approaches as simply as combining a dataset with other data sources, e.g. publicly available information [1]. This poses a problem for data sharing, especially in highly sensitive domains such as medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Synthetic data allows to generate new examples that preserve the statistical properties of the original data [2]. In a medical use case, synthetic data could be used to generate realistic but entirely artificial medical records. These synthetic medical records can be used for a variety of different purposes, such as augmenting existing datasets or sharing data without revealing any patient information [3].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the later, however, synthetic data doesn&amp;rsquo;t per se protect the privacy of individual patients. To achieve privacy preservation, we have to apply additional techniques such as differential privacy [4]. The aim of this project is to evaluate synthetic data generation with differential privacy for tabular medical records. You will first evaluate current literature of synthetic data generation for tabular data with regards to medical records [5, 6]. In the following, a data generation pipeline will be implemented and analysed to evaluate the performance of existing synthetisation approaches on a real-world multiple sclerosis dataset. The data will be used to predict disease activity and help treatment decision making for disease-modifying therapies [7]. To measure the prediction capabilities of the synthetically generated private data, its prediction performance is compared against existing baselines from the original data curated during different time intervals. Furthermore, the addition of synthetic data into the existing training process for increased model robustness will be assessed. This project will help to evaluate the ability of synthetic data to enable data sharing in a privacy preserving manner and additionally its potential benefits for increasing model robustness due to data augmentation.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;your-qualifications&#34;&gt;Your qualifications&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are looking for a highly motivated Master&amp;rsquo;s student in Computer Science, Physics, Engineering or Mathematics. You will establish a comprehensive pipeline in PyTorch or JAX to generate and evaluate synthetic data from a real world medical dataset under differential privacy. You will be working at the institute for AI in Medicine, at the Privacy-Preserving and Trustworthy Machine Learning Group. Importantly, we aim to publish the results of this work, with you, in a follow up study at a high-impact deep learning conference or in an academic journal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong motivation and interest in deep learning and generative neural networks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advanced programming skills in Python and a common DL framework (PyTorch, Tensorflow, JAX).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Independent working style with strong interest in teamwork.&lt;/li&gt;
