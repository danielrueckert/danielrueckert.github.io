      <title>MSc Thesis: An attention-based image denoising network leveraging information of both spatial and frequency domain</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;description&#34;&gt;Description&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Image denoising task, in which a clean image is recovered from a noise observation, is a classical inverse problem and still active topic in low-level vision since it is an indispensable step in many practical applications. In past decades, a large variety of image denoising methods employing neural networks were proposed to solve this inverse problem. These methods are major in the spatial domain which denoise the image straightforwardly by extracting the spatial information using the sliding CNN window. On the other hand, image denoising from the frequency domain also has a long history in which the low-pass filter techniques are applied and the noise (major in high-frequency space) can be filtered out. The denoising optimization in the frequency domain is frequently utilized in medical image reconstruction. Recently a great number of frequency networks with CNNs are used in this field to improve the reconstruction quality. However, this approach is rarely studied in the nature denoising field with RGB images. More recently, the advent of Transformers evolutes the computer vision field. Its inherent attributes like larger receptive field and lower inductive bias facilitate the image denoising tasks.
In this work, we attempt to introduce a hybrid image denoising network that optimizes the noise image from both spatial and frequency domain. A comparison with SOTA methods on public datasets like urban100 or SIDD will be conducted in the end.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Internship / External MSc Project at Philips Research Hamburg: Loss functions for MRI reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://aim-lab.io/theses/mri_philips/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Techniques from Deep Learning have become a central building block in the development of medical image reconstruction algorithms. For example, neural networks have been used to accelerate and improve MR and CT reconstructions, thereby allowing reduction of measurement duration or radiation dose.  A central issue in the training of these networks is the choice of the objective functions, or loss functions, that do not generally reflect human visual perception. The aim of this Master’s Project is to study and develop suitable feature-based loss functions, which can be used for improving deep-learning based techniques in medical image reconstruction. An initial direction of study would be the unsupervised training of a feature loss based on a database of MR images and the subsequent application of the resulting loss in downstream tasks such as image reconstruction or contrast-to-contrast mapping.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MSc Thesis: Motion-Compensated MRI Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://aim-lab.io/theses/motionmri/</link>

      <guid>https://aim-lab.io/theses/motionmri/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Long acquisition times in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) bear the risk of patient motion, which substantially degrades the image quality. Further sources of image degradation are physiological motion, such as periodic respiratory and cardiac motion. Accelerated acquisitions can compensate for the motion. The motion information can also be derived from the acquired MRI data retrospectively and used as a correction step in image reconstruction. The objective of this thesis is to include the motion model directly in MRI reconstruction using both knowledge of the acquisition physics and machine learning. Motion-Compensated MRI reconstruction offers a wide range of opportunities for projects, where we can set the emphasis based on your interests. Please get in touch with us to find an individual topic!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MSc Thesis: Combining longitudinal volumetric imaging and tabular data for depression prediction</title>
      <link>https://aim-lab.io/theses/depression_prediction/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 27 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://aim-lab.io/theses/depression_prediction/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The objective of this project is to combine volumetric imaging and non-imaging longitudinal data to accurately analyze individual patients and provide automated decisions regarding diagnosis and disease prognosis. Physicians consider various medical biomarkers and meta-data to reach a clinical decision. Thus, creating computer-assisted diagnostic systems that operate in a similar manner could be highly beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aim is to align imaging and other medical information, such as medical history, blood values, sleep habits, genetic information, and more, in the feature space using a contrastive loss. The approach will integrate multiple modalities of each patient from various time points in the same model in an end-to-end fashion. The method can be fully supervised or be used in a self-supervision scheme, in which our model can learn the aligned embedding space of imaging and non-imaging data using a proxy task from the data itself. Afterward, the learned embeddings can be finetuned for downstream tasks, such as depression prediction [1].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project will be completed under the supervision of Dr. Magdalini Paschali (Stanford University) and Vasiliki Sideri-Lampretsa (TUM). Computational resources and datasets [1] will be provided.

      <title>MSc Thesis: Federated, privacy preserving deep learning for fetal MRI brain segmentation</title>
      <link>https://aim-lab.io/theses/maik/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 19 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://aim-lab.io/theses/maik/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In medical domain data protection and privacy preservation is highly relevant. Therefore, clinical data of patients is usually securely stored on clinic servers without access from outside.
Publication of clinical data is difficult and cumbersome as strict privacy and data protection laws must be obeyed.
These involve anonymization of patient data, drafting of data sharing agreements, and the approval of the corresponding ethics commission.
This complex publication process is one of the key reasons for data shortage in medical domain and is often preventing machine learning approaches to reach their full potential.
Federated learning [1] paired with differential privacy [2,3] can circumvent the problem of data publication.
Rather than gathering the data from clinical sites to centrally train a machine learning model, the model is distributed to the different sites, locally trained on the (partial) data, and finally, globally aggregated [2].
Thus, patient data is never seen by third parties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to construct a proof of concept for a federated learning approach in the domain of fetal MRI segmentation. An existing baseline segmentation model must be modified and embedded in a federated learning environment. The model must then be trained on fetal MRI scans located on several international clinic servers. Furthermore, sufficient privacy standards (e.g. differential privacy [2]) must be discussed and ensured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;your-qualifications&#34;&gt;Your qualifications:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;advanced knowledge in machine learning and computer vision (experience in federated learning or differential privacy is helpful but not mandatory)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;good programming skills in Python and a deep learning framework (previous work is based on
PyTorch).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;good communication skills. The project will require you to cooperate with different clinics of various countries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>MSc Thesis: Non-invasive and accurate prediction of prostate cancer aggressiveness</title>
      <link>https://aim-lab.io/theses/prostate_cancer/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 28 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://aim-lab.io/theses/prostate_cancer/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;With estimates of 1 600 000 cases and more than 350 000 deaths annually worldwide, prostate cancer is among the most common cancers in men [1]. Diagnosis of prostate cancer is typically done by using ultrasound-guided needle biopsies. An approach that not only involves risks, due to the invasive nature of the method, but also generally underestimates the aggressiveness of the tumor [2]. Standard positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with prostate cancer specific tracers and specifically PSMA-PET have shown to be advantageous for delineating suspicious lesions during biopsy [3, 4].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to use the information provided by these PET and multi-parametric MRI images to directly predict Gleason scores that accurately report the aggressiveness of the prostate cancers without the risks associated with an invasive biopsy. Recent research at our institution has produced promising results predicting Gleason scores from handcrafted radiomic features [5]. This work aims at building on top of this research and to develop an end-to-end deep learning pipeline for predicting tumor aggressiveness directly from different imaging modalities. We have exclusive access to a dataset which includes PSMA-11 PET/MRI scans, segmentation maps and the pathological information of the tumors. Additional public data is available through the &lt;a href=&#34;https://pi-cai.grand-challenge.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;PI-CAI Challenge&lt;/a&gt;. The focus of this work is to build a complete pipeline for analysing multi-modal medical imaging datasets. This includes research on understanding the diverse data available, exploring different approaches for dealing with the limited dataset size (data augmentation, pre-training etc.) and finding a suitable model and evaluation metric for this use case.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;your-qualifications&#34;&gt;Your qualifications:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are looking for a highly motivated Master’s student in Computer Science, Physics, Engineering or Mathematics. You will establish a comprehensive medical imaging pipeline in PyTorch to extract information from these images. You will be working together with me and under the supervision of Prof. Daniel Rückert. Importantly, we aim to publish the results of this work, with you, in a follow up study at a high-impact medical imaging conference or in an academic journal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong motivation and interest in machine learning and medical imaging.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advanced programming skills in Python and a common DL framework (PyTorch, Tensorflow).&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>MSc Thesis: Adversarial attacks in collaborative machine learning</title>
      <link>https://aim-lab.io/theses/attacks/</link>

      <guid>https://aim-lab.io/theses/attacks/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Collaborative machine learning has became the new paradigm-of-choice when it comes to training deep learning models in many fields, including medical image analysis. Due to a number of data protection and governance regulations being introduced, direct data sharing for such training is rendered problematic. As a result implementations that rely on local training, such as federated learning (FL) have been widely adopted. However, a number of studies [1,2] have shown that such paradigms are deeply vulnerable to adversarial influence either in the form of privacy violation [3] or utility degradation [4]. Fortunately for the research community, such attacks are often very fragile and require a number of assumptions to hold in practise. The aim of this project is to explore the recent advances in adversarial machine learning in order to investigate how to adapt them to the real-world machine learning contexts in order to encourage the research community and policymakers to employ safe, robust and privacy-preserving systems when working with sensitive personally-identifying information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project is deliberately very open-ended, as there is a large number of various attack vectors that could be pursued: attacks on membership, reconstruction of sensitive attributes or training samples, insertion of auxiliary learning tasks etc. Our lab has experience primarily with privacy-oriented attacks on machine learning, but we are otherwise happy to consider students with interest in any other attack formulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project aims to unite the areas of interpretable deep learning and defenses against attacks on collaborative learning. A number of approaches identifying the so-called critical neurons and pathways have previously been proposed to aid the community in interpretation of the predictions made by deep learning models[5,6,7]. We want to determine if these neurons/pathways are also critical for the adversary when it comes to extraction of information or destruction of utility of a jointly trained model.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MSc Thesis: Transformer based Graph Extraction</title>
      <link>https://aim-lab.io/theses/masther_thesis_relationformer/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 13 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://aim-lab.io/theses/masther_thesis_relationformer/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this Master thesis we aim to address the graph extraction problem using a new powerful class of neural networks - Transformers [2][3]. A comprehensive representation of an image requires understanding objects and their mutual relationship, especially in image-to-graph generation, e.g., road network extraction, blood-vessel network extraction, or scene graph generation.
Traditionally, image-to-graph generation is addressed with a two-stage approach consisting of object detection followed by a separate relation prediction, which prevents simultaneous object-relation interaction. In our recent ECCV paper, we proposed a unified one-stage transformer-based framework, namely &lt;em&gt;Relationformer&lt;/em&gt; that jointly predicts objects and their relations [1].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a next step we aim to apply the &lt;em&gt;Relationformer&lt;/em&gt; to large scale biological applications for example the whole brain vasculature [4] or neurons. We plan to explore concepts of domain-adaptation and transfer learning. Please see exemplary images of the whole brain vasculature and the &lt;em&gt;Relationformer&lt;/em&gt; model below.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MSc Thesis: Transformer-based Mesh Analysis for Brain Aneurysm Detection</title>
      <link>https://aim-lab.io/theses/masther_thesis_aneyrism/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 13 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Detecting aneurysm in 3D volumetric TOF MRA is difficult because a) the variation in shape information of aneurysms is hard to capture in patch-based 3D approach using just intensity information b) processing full 3D volumetric image is computationally demanding. In this Master thesis we aim to address this with shape analysis of blood vessels. Vessel surface lies in a non-Euclidean manifold which can be described by its i) vertices i.e. point-cloud ii) mesh i.e. vertices, edges and faces.  Thus we reformulate aneurysm detection as into two sub tasks on segmented vessel: i) aneurysm recognition: classification of vessel mesh ii) aneurysm segmentation: part segmentation of vessel surface.  We aim to translate recent progress of the transformer based model [1,2] for this geometric deep learning task on multiple vessel mesh  datasets [3,4].&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>B.Sc. Thesis: Collection of a German Biomedical Text Corpus from Public Sources</title>
      <link>https://aim-lab.io/theses/data_collection/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 31 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://aim-lab.io/theses/data_collection/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recent successes in Natural Language Processing (NLP) are based on pre-training language models on large datasets of unlabelled text.
In the medical domain however, such large datasets are hard to acquire. Especially in the German Medical domain, very few public text datasets are available which limits the availability of pre-trained language models and therefore the success of NLP in this domain.
Instead fo relying on clinical texts that are typically hard to acquire due to privacy issues, we will therefore create a large German Medical corpus based on public sources.
These public sources include academic publications and book, dissertations (e.g. from the university library), and online sources like Wikipedia.
Additionally, we will create a smaller paired German-English corpus from bilingual thesauri and ontologies like the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;your-tasks-include&#34;&gt;Your tasks include&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Selection of sources for the corpus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automatic extraction from the sources (e.g. web crawling, text/section extraction from pdf-files, extraction from structured files like csv or xml) and data cleaning (if required)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Definition of the target structure for the corpus and integrating of all selected sources into this structure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explorative data analysis, i.e. computing dataset statistics and visualising properties of the dataset&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;requirements&#34;&gt;Requirements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advanced programming skills in Python&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience in web crawling or data collection is preferable but not required&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>MSc Thesis: AI against SARS-CoV-2</title>
      <link>https://aim-lab.io/theses/ai-virus/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Viruses interact with cellular proteins to replicate and spread. We aim to gain functional insights into the mode of action of cellular proteins, enabling us to better understand how different viruses like SARS-CoV-2 cause disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are using genetic ablation of cellular proteins and viruses that express a green fluorescent protein (GFP), allowing us to continuously follow the infection by live-cell fluorescent microscopy in a time-resolved manner.  The resulting, very rich dataset (consisting of ~60.000 images per virus tested), will be used to search for patterns allowing to classify the function of the perturbed gene in relation to the infecting virus.  For instance, the GFP intensity/area, the localization, and spatial proximity of a GFP signal over time contains information on virus replication and spread.  This work aims to establish and apply unbiased machine learning algorithms to understand these functional links between the cell and the viruses and to identify the proteins and perturbations that contribute to virus growth and virus restriction. This algorithm will further be used to study the influence of inflammatory events and treatment with drug libraries.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;your-qualifications&#34;&gt;Your qualifications:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are looking for a highly motivated Master’s student who will establish a comprehensive bioinformatics pipeline to extract information from these images. You will be working together with computational scientists at the AI in Medicine Lab and wet-lab scientists (Prof. Andreas Pichlmair group, Virology). Importantly, your results will be functionally tested iteratively and used to further improve the predictive power of your model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advanced programming skills in Python&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong background in deep learning and image analysis&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>MSc Thesis: Contrastive Pre-Training for Radiology Reports</title>
      <link>https://aim-lab.io/theses/report_pretraining/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In recent years transformer-based language models have proven quite successful in the field of natural language processing (NLP).
These models require huge amounts of training data and are therefore typically pre-trained on unlabelled datasets using self-supervised objectives
like masked language modelling (MLM) as proposed in BERT [1].
While models like BioBERT [2] are pre-trained on the medical domain, the used pre-training objectives like MLM treat text as independent sentences and do not utilise the structure of medical documents.
In this project we instead make use of the semi-structured nature of radiology reports and apply contrastive methods on the sections of these reports.
Your task is the adaptation of such contrastive methods (e.g. SimCLR [3], BYOL [4], DINO [5], …) to be used effectively on language models.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MSc Thesis: Unsupervised deep learning for vessel segmentation in optical coherence tomography angiographs</title>
      <link>https://aim-lab.io/theses/octa/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 23 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is an imaging technique that visualizes blood vessels by detecting motion of red blood cells in sequential scans [1]. It has seen initial adoption for the diagnosis and monitoring of clinical conditions that affect the retinal vasculature, such as several different eye diseases or multiple sclerosis [2, 3]. However, its effective clinical use is often impeded by the occurrence of imaging artifacts and lack of tools that can extract the vessel maps from the images. Only few studies have explored the use of deep-learning-based segmentation to delineate vessels in two-dimensional OCTA images [4, 5]. The development of three-dimensional (3D) segmentation algorithms has proven difficult due to a lack of publicly available datasets with ground truth annotations, which are difficult and time-consuming to acquire for the large and complex OCTA images [5].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project aims at tackling the problem of 3D vessel segmentation in OCTA images using unsupervised and weakly supervised deep learning. The prospective student will adopt existing deep-learning-based segmentation algorithms so that these can be trained using self-supervision and noisy annotations. All developed methods will be evaluated on a large dataset of OCTA images collected at the Klinikum rechts der Isar.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Machine learning, in particular deep learning, has reformed the research in the field of medical imaging, and the focus of this project will be on its use for the prediction of disease progression/ neurological outcome in stroke patients. Stroke patients have a high risk of developing dementia (incidence around 20%) within a few months after the event, but so far the reasons and mechanisms are poorly understood [1]. Clinical parameters, such as age, smoking habit and previous health conditions have an influence, but are not sufficient to reliably predict the cognitive outcome. Imaging, for example magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), becomes increasingly important.
The objective of this thesis is to develop a learning-based pipeline, and investigate and identify imaging biomarkers from structural and diffusion MRI to predict poststroke dementia.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MSc Thesis: Machine Learning for Analysis of Sarcoma</title>
      <link>https://aim-lab.io/theses/old/sarcoma/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 10 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;description&#34;&gt;Description&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early diagnosis of musculoskeletal tumours is crucial for successful therapy and treatment. The sooner a potential malignant growth is detected, the more effective the next steps in therapy and the better a prognosis usually becomes. The rarity of musculoskeletal tumours, potentially inexperienced clinicians with this certain entity, as well as unspecific anamnesis and clinical manifestations may delay the final diagnosis. Whereas currently available imaging modalities yield considerable insights into tumour staging and grading, biopsy remains the gold standard for final diagnosis. Yet, the planning of a successful biopsy yielding sufficient material might require time aside from a high level of experience and may delay the final diagnosis even further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complexity in conjunction with multimodal approaches in fully grasping this disease provide a very suitable foundation for modern artificial intelligence algorithms. Not only for diagnostic purposes, but also for treatment planning or prognosis prediction, machine learning and deep learning algorithms are popular techniques in many disciplines at this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;tasks&#34;&gt;Tasks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Various topics in the domain of musculoskeletal tumor analysis are available for a master thesis in computer science and can be discussed during an interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Analysis of sarcoma with machine/deep learning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coping with very limited and unbalanced datasets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adaption to medicine specific issues with AI&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the great success of our on-going seminar on Deep Learning for Medical Applications, we would like to discuss advanced topics that are quite relevant to Federated Learning which becomes an interesting and hot research direction in the community. In simple words, Federated Learning enables training models at the client-side while preserving their privacy, and aggregates the knowledge from the nodes to learn a global model. The interesting part here that the data are kept private and not transmitted to any other nodes. Instead, the characteristics (e.g. parameters) of the global model are shared with the clients, and once the training is done locally, the characteristics are sent back to the global one for aggregation. This learning paradigm has been received quite nicely in the community, in particular, for sensitive domains, e.g. Healthcare. To push this momentum, we proposed, together with our academia and industry partners, a workshop on Federated, Collaborative, and Distributed Learning in the International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer-Aided Intervention (MICCAI) to attract significant contributions attacking the challenges in Medical Imaging and Healthcare. In this seminar, we will be discussing the relevant papers on Federated Learning with an emphasis on the papers tackling the common challenges in Medical Imaging, e.g. data heterogeneity, domain shift, and non-iid distributed data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;details&#34;&gt;Details&lt;/h2&gt;

      <title>MSc Thesis: Distributionally robust neural networks in medical imaging</title>
      <link>https://aim-lab.io/theses/old/robust/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Deep learning has revolutionized the field of medical imaging. However, the performance of a model drops when the distribution of the test data is different from the distribution of the training data. This is especially critical in a medical setting, where the amount of labelled training data is often limited, and in particular for the application in clinical routine, where the distribution of the test data cannot be controlled. Typical problems are here domain shift, bias in the training data and out-of-distribution samples (e.g., pathologies, image artefacts).
In this project, we will explore distributionally robust optimization (DRO) [1,2] for deep learning in medical imaging. Instead of minimizing the average loss of a training set, DRO minimizes the worst-case risk and with this optimizes the performances on ”hard” examples. The student will adapt and develop novel methods using DRO for medical imaging applications (classification, segmentation and/or registration.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MSc Thesis: Out-of-distribution detection using contrastive training for medical imaging</title>
      <link>https://aim-lab.io/theses/old/oodd/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Deep learning has revolutionized the field of medical imaging. However, the performance of a model drops when the distribution of the test data is different from the distribution of the training data. This is especially critical in a medical setting, where the amount of labelled training data is often limited, and in particular for the application in clinical routine, where the distribution of the test data cannot be controlled. The automatic detection of such Out-of-Distribution (OoD) samples at inference is important for the design of reliable models, but also to identify poor quality images and pathologies not seen during training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, contrastive learning has shown to provide state-of-the-art results for OoD in image classification benchmarks [1]. Contrastive learning is an approach to formulate the task of finding similar and dissimilar samples during training. One advantage of the proposed method is that no OoD data is required during training.
The aim of this project is to explore OoD detection in deep learning in general, and in particular the use of contrastive training. The student will develop and implement (novel) methods for image classification, segmentation, and/or registration in a medical application.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Privacy-preserving artificial intelligence techniques such as differential privacy, encryption and multi-party computation can reconcile the needs for data utilisation and data protection in the medical domain, as mandated by legal and ethical requirements. Their widespread utilisation requires innovations in the fields of distributed machine learning (federated learning) as well as answering open questions in privacy research and cryptography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are seeking an MSc candidate with a strong background in machine learning, preferrably with previous exposure to medical imaging topics to complete their thesis at our institute. Experience with distributed systems, privacy and security issues or cryptology is desirable.
We are offering an engaging work environment, a large, diverse team, close personal supervision and collaboration with AI, medical and privacy-preserving ML experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can accommodate a wide range of interests from your side! Please get in touch with us to find an appropriate topic. We are also able to supervise guided research projects, smaller in scope than full MSc theses.&lt;/p&gt;
