      <title>MSc Thesis: Machine Learning in Fetal MRI Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://aim-lab.io/theses/fetal/</link>

      <description>Fetal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has become increasingly important to assess the development of the fetal brain. However, the acquisition is challenging due to the uncontrollable fetal motion. This requires both improved MR acquisition and reconstruction procedures.</description>

      <description>Long acquisition times in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) bear the risk of patient motion, which substantially degrades the image quality. Further sources of image degradation are physiological motion, such as periodic respiratory and cardiac motion.</description>

      <title>MSc Thesis: Physics-Driven Self-Supervised Learning in MRI Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://aim-lab.io/theses/physicsmri/</link>

      <description>Machine learning has evolved tremendously to accelerate the inherently low acquisition process of Magnetic Resonance (MR) images. However, it is challenging to obtain ground truth data for learning MRI reconstruction. The objective of this MSc thesis is to explore self-supervised learning for MRI reconstruction, where only the measurement (k-space) data and knowledge about the acquisition physics are available.</description>

      <description>Distributed deep learning systems can help ascertain data governance and sovereignty while allowing the training of algorithms on larger an more diverse datasets. This is particularly beneficial in the medical domain, in which the collection and curation of large datasets is especially difficult.</description>
