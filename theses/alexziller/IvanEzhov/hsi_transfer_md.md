Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is an optical technique that processes the electromagnetic spectrum at a multitude of monochromatic, adjacent frequency bands. The wide-bandwidth spectral signature of a target object's reflectance allows fingerprinting its physical, biochemical, and physiological properties. HSI has been applied for various applications, such as remote sensing and biological tissue analysis. Recently, HSI was also used to differentiate between healthy and pathological tissue under operative conditions in a surgery room on patients diagnosed with brain tumors [1]. 

Within the [HyperProbe](https://hyperprobe.eu) project, we aim to develop a novel all-optical, AI-powered intraoperative imaging system to transform monitoring of brain tumour surgery. 
Your goal would be to develop a methodology at the intersection between physics and machine-learning to identify biomarkers of healthy and tumor brain tissue.
