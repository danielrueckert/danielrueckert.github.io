      <title>BSc / Guided Research: Multi-object and multi-modal image segmentation of periodontal lesions in MRI</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Periodontitis (chronic or acute alterations of the periodontium) is among the globally widest spread diseases, and interacts with cardiovascular and metabolic disorders. The diagnosis and monitoring of periodontitis is mainly based on imaging modalities exhibiting ionizing radiation: X-ray (panoramic radiography) and cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). Recent studies report the successful use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the application of periodontitis diagnosis [1]. Two MRI sequences were developed: a T1-weighted sequence to visualise osseous tissue, and a T2-weighted sequence to visualise the periodontal lesion. To enable automatic diagnosis and monitoring of the disease, accurate segmentations of several anatomical structures, such as the mandibular bone, the alveolar nerve and the periodontal lesion are of utmost importance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The objective of this project is the multi-modal segmentation of mandibular bone, alveolar nerve and periodontal lesions in MRI images. The prospective student will explore state-of-the-art deep-learning-based segmentation methods such as [2], and compare them for binary and multi-class segmentation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>BSc / Guided Research: Prediction of long-term cognitive outcome in Stroke patients using machine learning</title>
      <link>https://aim-lab.io/theses/veronikazimmer/stroke/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Machine learning, in particular deep learning, has reformed the research in the field of medical imaging, and the focus of this project will be on its use for the prediction of disease progression/ neurological outcome in stroke patients. Stroke patients have a high risk of developing dementia (incidence around 20%) within a few months after the event, but so far the reasons and mechanisms are poorly understood [1]. Clinical parameters, such as age, smoking habit and previous health conditions have an influence, but are not sufficient to reliably predict the cognitive outcome. Imaging, for example magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), becomes increasingly important. Recently, we have developed a novel method to predict cognitive outcome after a stroke with a balanced accuracy of 80% [2].  One drawback of the current model is that is relies on a complex preprocessing pipeline, including image registration and semi-automatic segmentation, which hinders its usefullness in clinical routine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The objective of this project is to develop a fully automatic end-to-end pipeline for cognitive outcome prediction in stroke patients. This will include (i) automating the segmentations using state-of-the-art learning-based segmentation methods, (ii) identifying the most influential preprocessing steps, and (iii) development of a functioning fully automatic pipeline for easy usability by clinicians and neurologists.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MSc Thesis: transfer learning for segmentation of tubular structures in thoracic CT images</title>
      <link>https://aim-lab.io/theses/martinmenten/thoracic_ct_processing/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Computed tomography (CT) scans are commonly used in clinic practice to diagnose and monitor diseases of the lung, heart and upper abdomen [1]. Deep learning has seen wide-spread application for the segmentation of organs in CT images [2,3]. However, its use for segmentation of complex, tubular structures, such as the bronchial proximal airways or cardiac vasculature, has been inhibited by a lack of high-quality ground truth labels [4]. In this research project, the prospective student will investigate the use of unsupervised learning and transfer learning to segment complex structures in chest CT images without having to rely on large amounts of ground truth annotations.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MSc Thesis: Distributionally robust neural networks in medical imaging</title>
      <link>https://aim-lab.io/theses/old/robust/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Deep learning has revolutionized the field of medical imaging. However, the performance of a model drops when the distribution of the test data is different from the distribution of the training data. This is especially critical in a medical setting, where the amount of labelled training data is often limited, and in particular for the application in clinical routine, where the distribution of the test data cannot be controlled. Typical problems are here domain shift, bias in the training data and out-of-distribution samples (e.g., pathologies, image artefacts).
In this project, we will explore distributionally robust optimization (DRO) [1,2] for deep learning in medical imaging. Instead of minimizing the average loss of a training set, DRO minimizes the worst-case risk and with this optimizes the performances on ”hard” examples. The student will adapt and develop novel methods using DRO for medical imaging applications (classification, segmentation and/or registration.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MSc Thesis: Out-of-distribution detection using contrastive training for medical imaging</title>
      <link>https://aim-lab.io/theses/old/oodd/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Deep learning has revolutionized the field of medical imaging. However, the performance of a model drops when the distribution of the test data is different from the distribution of the training data. This is especially critical in a medical setting, where the amount of labelled training data is often limited, and in particular for the application in clinical routine, where the distribution of the test data cannot be controlled. The automatic detection of such Out-of-Distribution (OoD) samples at inference is important for the design of reliable models, but also to identify poor quality images and pathologies not seen during training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, contrastive learning has shown to provide state-of-the-art results for OoD in image classification benchmarks [1]. Contrastive learning is an approach to formulate the task of finding similar and dissimilar samples during training. One advantage of the proposed method is that no OoD data is required during training.
The aim of this project is to explore OoD detection in deep learning in general, and in particular the use of contrastive training. The student will develop and implement (novel) methods for image classification, segmentation, and/or registration in a medical application.&lt;/p&gt;
