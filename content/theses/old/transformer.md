## Description
Deep learning has reached a new era in 2021, with Transformer-based networks making a name for themselves in Computer vision tasks, topping the Leaderboard in Recognition, Detection and Segmentation [1-3]. However, the power of Transformers has not been researched in optical flow estimation. Based on our current knowledge about optical flow and Transformers, we believe that Transformer has the potential to surpass the state-of-the-art convolution-based networks like [4-6] in the field of flow estimation. During this project, you will develop a brand new transformer-based neural network aiming at solving the flow estimation problem, and test them on leading benchmarks like Sintel [7] and KITTI [8]. Are you ready for this challenge?

## We offer
- A warm start of the project with the state-of-the-art knowledge of the group in this field
- A chance to collaborate with international experts in Deep learning who have connected with our lab
- A chance to publish if the work shines

## We expect you have
- Strong background in linear algebra and Deep Learning, familiar with the classic CNN backbones
- proficiency in Python, experience with Tensorflow, Pytorch and/or JAX
- Knowledge in Optical Flow Estimation and/or Transformer would be a big plus
- Passions in Research and Computer vision (which is the most important thing)

If you are interested in this work and ready for a new challenge, please feel free to contact us:)
