Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning is a very recent topic of ongoing research. Especially in the medical field large amounts of data are locked due to privacy regulations. PPML allows the training on data of patients while asserting they face no repercussions by participating. Lots of applications need to be researched in depth. Exact project definitions would be specified depending on your interests and talents, but range from rather theoretical work to heavily applied projects. If you are interested kindly send us a message including your CV, transcript of records, and very briefly what you are looking for, expecting in your thesis, your talents and interests are and if applicable a short description of a project that you did. We are looking forward to your message.
