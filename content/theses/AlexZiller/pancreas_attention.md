Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is considered the fourteenth most common cancer globally, the seventh on the list of causes of cancer death in 2020, and the fourth in 2021. 
To further investigate the causes and therapy for affected patients we aim to extend our previous work. This project is ideal for students who like to work on applied deep learning in the medical field. 
In particular in this thesis we aim to evaluate the effect of attention mechanisms to the prediction of therapy response and/or other labels for PDAC patients. Hence, after an in-depth literature research you have the opportunity to implement and evaluate the most promising approaches and compare to previous work. Experience in deep learning and good practices in software engineering are thus a requirement. Note that we do explicitly not require any previous medical knowledge.\
If you are interested kindly send us a message <b>including your CV and transcript of records</b>. Please also describe briefly what you are looking for and why you are suited to this thesis. Optionally describe a previous deep learning project you have worked on. We are looking forward to your message.
