title: "MSc Thesis: Fairness in Unsupervised Anomaly Detection"

Unsupervised anomaly detection methods use unlabeled data from one distribution for training and can then differentiate between samples that come from that distribution and samples from other distributions.
In medical applications, anomalies often correspond to diseases and can be detected with such methods. This is a way to make use of the large amounts of clinically unremarkable data available.
While it is known that supervised machine learning models show worse performance for minority groups that are usually underrepresented in the data, this problem has so far not been studied for unsupervised methods despite the large implications a potentially unfair clinical application could have.

This Masters Thesis will investigate (un)fairness of anomaly detection models used for medical disease detection under different definitions of fairness and will try to offer mitigation strategies.
