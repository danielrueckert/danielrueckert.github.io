The position of attachment points of ligaments and muscles on vertebral bodies are crucial for biomechanical simulations.

Your task would be to compare existing methods and develop a model to accurately predict these points onto given vertebrae. The task is similar to Landmark prediction (https://paperswithcode.com/task/facial-landmark-detection/latest), which is used in deep-fake, for example. 

You will be working with 3D CT images and segmentations. You are given a hand-made Ground-Truth for the points as well as a prediction of points using registration with some selected "known-goods". 

The tasks are:
- Using the registrated data, make a preselection of the dataset.
- Make a first baseline approach using the registrated data/points.
- After a initial research phase, develop and train a DL model to outperform the registration approach.

Later steps could involve using the predicted POIs to measure the form of the vertebrae, i.e. for fracture detection.

## Your Qualifications:

- Most important: solid coding skills and familiarity with PyTorch and Numpy
- Strong background in machine learning
- Motivated master student in Informatics, Mathematics, or a closely related field
- Ability to thoroughly answer a research question
- Strong research mindset
