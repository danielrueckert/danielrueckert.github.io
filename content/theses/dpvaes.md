Medical datasets are due to privacy protection laws scarce and often in few quantities. One approach to overcome this challenge is to use generative approaches trained on private datasets and by this sample new fake data from the same distribution [1]. However, generative approaches tend to memorize training data and thus the risk of leaking private data remains. The gold standard technique to limit information about samples in the dataset is the usage of differential privacy [2]. There have been successful approaches using generative networks to create synthetic imaging data while using DP-SGD [3, 4]. In this project we would like to explore using variational autoencoders (VAEs) for private synthetic image generation.
