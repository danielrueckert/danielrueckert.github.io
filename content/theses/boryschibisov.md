We are an international team of experts in the field of NLP and AI looking for a highly motivated Master's student to join us for a master thesis project. Our main focus is the development of Doctos, an app that generates dental documentation through speech-to-text and converts the documentation into relevant billing codes using Named Entity Recognition. The documentation and the generated billing codes are automatically imported into the relevant PVS.
The objective of this thesis is to compare different methods for automatic recognition of billing codes from dental documentation. In particular, the focus will be on Named Entity Recognition techniques and their implementation in Doctos.
