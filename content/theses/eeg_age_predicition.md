Electroencephalography (EEG) data represents the electrical activity of the brain over time. EEG signals are collected with thin electrodes placed on the scalp. They detect tiny electrical charges that result from the activity of brain cells. Given the simple and low-cost setup, the EEG is used in clinical practice to evaluate brain disorders (e.g. epilepsy), to diagnose diseases (e.g. Alzheimer's disease, narcolepsy), or simply to monitor blood flow in the brain. [1] 
  
Within the context of this thesis, a dataset containing the EEG recordings of chronic pain patients (chronic backpain, chronic widespread pain, joint pain, and neuropathic pain) and a matching healthy control group is provided by the University Hospital rechts der Isar. Previous work on EEG data of chronic pain patients has shown an increased brain connectivity at specific frequencies in frontal brain areas when compared to the healthy control group. [2] Furthermore, longitudinal studies indicate a global brain network change in chronic pain patients. [3] In this thesis we would like to investigate how brain age is affected by chronic diseases. The goal is to use self-supervised learning approaches to determine features that are shared across all EEG recordings. In a next step, the learned representations can then be used to predict the brain age of a given subject. Moreover, transfer learning techniques will be investigated to see whether knowledge gained from other types of EEG data can improve performance on the brain age regression task.
