Age prediction has been investigated intensively for brain imaging (brain age estimation) [1]. Here, it has been applied for early prediction of neurodegenerative diseases and the assessment of accelerated aging. However, there is very little research on abdominal age prediction which estimates the age of a person based on abdominal organs [2]. The goal of this project is to extend a previously implemented age prediction algorithm, which uses full body MR images as an input and apply interpretability methods like GradCAM on different slices as areas of the image, to investigate which parts of the body are predictive of a personâ€™s age. This can lead to medical insights about accelerated aging of different areas of the body, as well as which parts of the body are most relevant to estimate age.

This work will be using a dataset of about 40,000 whole body MR images from the UK Biobank [3].
