Collaborative machine learning has became the new paradigm-of-choice when it comes to training deep learning models in many fields, including medical image analysis. Due to a number of data protection and governance regulations being introduced, direct data sharing for such training is rendered problematic. As a result implementations that rely on local training, such as federated learning (FL) have been widely adopted. However, a number of studies [1,2] have shown that such paradigms are deeply vulnerable to adversarial influence either in the form of privacy violation [3] or utility degradation [4].

This project aims to unite the areas of interpretable deep learning and defenses against attacks on collaborative learning. A number of approaches identifying the so-called critical neurons and pathways have previously been proposed to aid the community in interpretation of the predictions made by deep learning models[5,6,7]. We want to determine if these neurons/pathways are also critical for the adversary when it comes to extraction of information or destruction of utility of a jointly trained model.
