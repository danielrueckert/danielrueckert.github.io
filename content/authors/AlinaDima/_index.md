I am a Ph.D. student at the Institute for Artificial Intelligence and Informatics in Medicine and the Institute of Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology at the Technical University of Munich, Germany. Originally from Romania, I completed my computer science education with a focus on machine learning and computer vision in Germany. During my master thesis at the Institute of Computer Graphics and Vision, part of the Technical University of Graz, I worked on hippocampus segmentation. I am currently developing learning-based methods for Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma, with the aim of improving patient survival.
