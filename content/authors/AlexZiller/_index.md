Alexander Ziller is a PhD student at the Institutes of Radiology and Artificial Intelligence and Informatics in Medicine at the Technical University of Munich (TUM). His research interest lies in the field of machine learning in medical imaging. He investigates the usage of deep learning methods for diagnostics of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, aiming at improved outcomes for tumour patients. He recognises the importance of privacy in medical imaging and is the lead developer of the PriMIA framework for secure and private deep learning in medical imaging, jointly developed by TUM, Imperial College London and OpenMined. He received his Master of Science in 2019 from TUM and was awarded the Intercultural Certificate for his efforts in connecting with other cultures.
