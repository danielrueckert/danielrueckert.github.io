Martin Menten is a senior researcher at the Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Informatics in Medicine. He is also affiliated with the BioMedIA group at Imperial College London. His research explores the development and application of machine learning algorithms for ophthalmology. In particular, he is interested in advancing the understanding and clinical management of age-related macular degeneration, the leading cause of blindness in the elderly. Before joining the lab of Professor Rueckert, Martin received his PhD in physics from the Institute of Cancer Research in 2018. There, he researched strategies to adapt external beam radiotherapy to anatomical changes in real-time in order to increase cure rates and reduce side effects of cancer treatments.
