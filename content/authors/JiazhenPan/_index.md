I am a Ph.D. student at the Institutes of Radiology and Artificial Intelligence and Informatics in Medicine at the Technical University of Munich (TUM). Before my Ph.D., I received my Master’s degree in Electrical Engineering and Information Technology at the University of Stuttgart with a focus on computer vision and pattern recognition. During my master's study, I wrote a research thesis with the collaboration of the Eberhard Karls University Tübingen, which focused on the whole body organ- and tissue segmentation problem. In my master thesis at King’s College London, I built a neural network that can solve the non-rigid registration problem directly from k-space for MR Imaging. Currently, I am researching applications of MRI Reconstruction, few-shot learning and flow estimation.
