Franz Rieger is a doctorate student in informatics at the Technical University of Munich and the Max Planck Institute of Neurobiology. There, he develops machine learning methods for connectomics, focussing on self-supervised techniques for segmenting large 3D electron microscopy brain scans. Before, he finished his Masterâ€™s in Informatics at the Technical University of Munich where he worked on Machine Learning for graphs.
