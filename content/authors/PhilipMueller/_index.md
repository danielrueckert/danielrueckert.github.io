Philip Müller is a Ph.D. student at the Institutes of Radiology and Artificial Intelligence and Informatics
in Medicine at the Technical University of Munich (TUM). In 2020 he received his Master's degree in Informatics at TUM with focus on deep learning. During his Master's thesis at the Computer Vision Group at TUM, he developed rotation-equivariant deep learning models for the use on diffusion-MRI scans. Currently, he is researching applications of multi-modal learning in radiology with focus on image and text modalities.
