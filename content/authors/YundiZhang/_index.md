Yundi Zhang is a PhD student at the Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Informatics in Medicine at the Technical University of Munich (TUM). She received her Master's degree from TUM in 2022, under the supervision of Prof. Reinhard Heckel of the Machine Learning and Information Processing group. Her previous research has focused on developing untrained coordinate-based Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) as deep image priors in image-related tasks such as accelerated MRI, image representation, and denoising. She is currently working on optimizing the data process path from source data to analysis using deep learning methods.
