Julian McGinnis is a PhD student at the Department of Neurology and the Institute of Artificial Intelligence in Medicine at the Technical University of Munich (TUM).
His research is centered on the intersection of medicine, neuroscience, and machine learning, specifically focusing on Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and the integrated analysis of the brain and spinal cord. His interests revolve around implicit neural representations and compact latent representations for various downstream tasks. These tasks include generative modeling, image reconstruction, and lesion segmentation. Topics for BSc and MSc theses, semester projects, or other student projects can always be discussed upon inquiry.
