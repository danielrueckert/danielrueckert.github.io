Aswathi is a PhD student co-supervised by Prof. Daniel Rückert (AI for Medicine) and PD Dr. Benedikt Wiestler (Neuroradiology). She obtained her Bachelor’s in Electronics and Communication Engineering from the University of Kerala, India. She pursued her Master’s in Control and Robotics, Signal and Image Processing at Ecole Centrale de Nantes, France. Aswathi carried out her Master’s thesis on the survival analysis of lymphoma patients using graph learning techniques. Her research interests lie in the domain of geometric deep-learning techniques for medical applications. Currently, she is working on deep-learning for longitudinal MRI analysis of multiple sclerosis patients.
