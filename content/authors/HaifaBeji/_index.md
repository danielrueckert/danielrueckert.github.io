I am a Ph.D. candidate engaged in a joint collaboration between Siemens Healthineers and the Artificial Intelligence and Informatics in Medicine lab at the Technical University of Munich (TUM). I received my Bachelor's and Master's degree in Electrical Engineering and Information Technology from TUM, with a focus on Robotics and AI. In my master thesis , I implemented a neural-network-based control systems for the 5DOF ophthalmic surgical robot path planning, conducted in partnership with the Chair of Robotics and Embedded Systems. With a strong passion for applying Machine Learning in healthcare, my current research focuses on assessing and mitigating bias and ensuring fairness in medical algorithms.
