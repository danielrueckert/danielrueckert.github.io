I am a Ph.D. student at the Institutes of Radiology and Artificial Intelligence and Informatics in Medicine at the Technical University of Munich (TUM). I completed both my bachelors and masters jointly at the TUM and LMU in Munich in the area of Bioinformatics. My previous projects and publications concern Multimodal Self-Supervised models with tabular and imaging data, GANs and volumetric brain data for Alzheimer's research and Next Generation Sequencing pipelines. Currently, I am developing multi-modal deep learning models that utilize the full breadth of information available in the medical domain, including patient lifestyle, genetic profile, and imaging data.
