Jonas Weidner is a PhD student affiliated with the Department of Neuroradiology and the Institute for Artificial Intelligence and Informatics in Medicine at the Technical University of Munich (TUM), advised by Prof. Dr. Daniel RÃ¼ckert and PD Dr. Benedikt Wiestler. He completed a degree in physics focusing on theoretical biophysics, where he worked on the topological chromatin organization of cancer cells and the simulation of spiking neural networks. Following an excursion into the field of economics, where he focused on predictive modeling of stock markets and carbon emissions, Jonas started his present position.
He is currently researching personalized brain tumor modeling for advanced radiotherapy planning, leveraging the interplay of machine learning and physical simulations.
