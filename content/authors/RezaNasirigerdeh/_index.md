Reza Nasirigerdeh is a Ph.D. student at the Institute of Artificial Intelligence in Medicine at the Technical University of Munich (TUM). He received his first master's degree in computer engineering (computer networks) from the Iran University of Science and Technology (IUST) and second master's degree in computer science (distributed systems) from the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC). His research focus is on privacy-preserving machine learning in general and federated learning in particular. He is currently developing the HyFed framework for general-purpose federated learning applications, sPLINK for federated genome-wide association studies, FedMMB for federated deep learning, and Flimma for federated gene expression analysis.
