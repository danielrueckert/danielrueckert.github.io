Hendrik Möller is a doctorate student in computer science at the University Hospital rechts der Isar at TUM. He works in an EU-funded project around the NAKO (transl. national cohort) dataset, a large MRI cohort representing the german population. He develops machine learning methods to label and segment these scans with a practical orientation.
Before that, he finished his Master’s in Robotics, Cognition, and Intelligence at the Technical University of Munich.
