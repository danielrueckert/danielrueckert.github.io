I'm a a PhD Candidate at the Chair for Artificial Intelligence in Medicine (TUM) and member of the Konrad Zuse School for Excellence in Reliable AI. Before starting my PhD, I graduated from Imperial College London with an MSc. in Advanced Computing and a BSc. from the University of Sussex.

My research is broadly focused around theoretical and practical aspects of trust and reliability in machine learning (ML) for medicine. I'm particularily interested in:

- understanding why and how neural networks memorise their training data
- improving utility & reliability of differentially private ML
- bias and fairness issues related to the deployment of ML models
- ML for scientific discovery and precision medicine
