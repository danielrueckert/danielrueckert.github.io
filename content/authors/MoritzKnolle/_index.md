Moritz Knolle is a researcher at the Institutes of Radiology and Artificial Intelligence and Informatics in Medicine at TUM. He graduated from the University of Sussex with a BSc. (Hons.) in Computer Science & Artificial Intelligence in the Summer of 2020. Initial work in his bachelor thesis was focused on efficient, deep learning-based semantic segmentation of the pancreas. More recently his work has been focused on exploring generative models as well as Bayesian approaches to deep learning with a combined focus on biomedical imaging (microscopy and histopathology) and CT data.
