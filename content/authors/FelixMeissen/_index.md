Felix Meissen is a Ph.D. student at the Institutes of Radiology and Artificial Intelligence and Informatics in Medicine at the Technical University of Munich (TUM). Before his Ph.D., he graduated from TUM with a Master of Science in Robotics, Cognition, and Intelligence. In his Master’s thesis at the Visual Computing Lab at TUM, he built generative models for facial animation based on audio. His research interests lie in unsupervised pre-training and transfer learning for anomaly detection in medical images.
