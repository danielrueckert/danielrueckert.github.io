Vasiliki Sideri-Lampretsa is a Ph.D. student at the Institute for Artificial Intelligence and Informatics in Medicine at the Technical University of Munich (TUM). She received her Diploma in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki and her Master's degree in Computer Science at TUM. She was a research assistant at the Interdisciplinary Research Lab (IFL) at TUM, where she also conducted her Master's thesis. During her Master's thesis, she focused on employing deep learning to tackle the inverse problem of predicting the speed of sound using ultrasound raw channel data aquired from simulations. Currently, her research interest lies in the field of machine learning in medical imaging, particularly in the fields of feature representation and unsupervised learning.
